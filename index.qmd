# Preliminaries {-}

## Background {-}

I designed this book to progressively introduce you to the analysis of data using linear models. My goal is to provide you with the skills needed to perform a linear regression analysis sooner rather than later. Most of the detailed derivations have been placed in **Going Deeper** sections or in their own chapter, which can be skipped over to more quickly progress through the material at the expense of less exposure to theory.

## Acknowledgments {-}

The writing of the book was partially supported by the Colorado Department of Higher Education as part of the proposal "OER for the Creation of Interactive Computational Notebooks and a Computational Pathway in Mathematics and Statistics".

The computational examples utilize the R programming language and environment [@R-base].

We will also make use of the following packages:

- **api2lm** [@R-api2lm].
- **dplyr** [@R-dplyr].
- **ggplot2** [@R-ggplot2]
- **knitr** [@R-knitr]
- **palmerpenguins** [@R-palmerpenguins]
- **plotly** [@R-plotly]
- **tidyverse** [@R-tidyverse].
