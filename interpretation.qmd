<!-- Interpreting a fitted model is a critical part of a regression analysis -->
<!-- and aids us in determining the role and impact that each variable plays -->
<!-- in describing the behavior of the response variable. -->

<!-- ## Interpretation of coefficients -->

<!-- The standard approach to interpreting the coefficients of a fitted -->
<!-- linear model is to consider the expected change in the response in -->
<!-- relation to changes in the regressors in the model. -->

<!-- Consider the typical multiple linear regression model of the response -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- Y=\beta_0+\beta_1 X_1 +\ldots + \beta_{p-1}X_{p-1}+\epsilon.(\#eq:mlr-equation-ch4) -->
<!-- $$ -->

<!-- As discussed in Chapter \@ref(linear-model-estimation), we treat the -->
<!-- values of our regressor variables as being fixed, known values. The -->
<!-- error term is treated as a random variable, and consequently, the -->
<!-- response variable is also a random variable. Additionally, we assume -->
<!-- that the errors all have mean 0, conditional on the values of the -->
<!-- regressor variables. More formally, we write this assumption as -->

<!-- $$ -->
<!-- E(\epsilon \mid X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_{p-1})=0.(\#eq:mean-error-assumption) -->
<!-- $$ -->

<!-- Recall that we use the notation $\mathbb{X} = \{X_1,\ldots,X_{p-1}\}$ to -->
<!-- denote the set of all regressors, which will help us simplify the -->
<!-- derivations below. Thus, the assumption in Equation -->
<!-- \@ref(eq:mean-error-assumption) can be expressed as -->
<!-- $E(\epsilon \mid \mathbb{X})=0$. Using the assumption in Equation -->
<!-- \@ref(eq:mean-error-assumption) and applying it to the model in Equation -->
<!-- \@ref(eq:mlr-equation-ch4), we see that -->

<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \begin{aligned} -->
<!-- & E(Y\mid X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_{p-1}) \\ -->
<!-- &= E(Y \mid \mathbb{X}) \\ -->
<!-- &= E(\beta_0+\beta_1 X_1 +\ldots + \beta_{p-1}X_{p-1}+\epsilon \mid \mathbb{X}) \\ -->
<!-- &= E(\beta_0+\beta_1 X_1 +\ldots + \beta_{p-1}X_{p-1}\mid \mathbb{X}) + E(\epsilon \mid \mathbb{X}) \\ -->
<!-- &=\beta_0+\beta_1 X_1 +\ldots + \beta_{p-1}X_{p-1} -->
<!-- \end{aligned} -->
<!-- $$ -->

<!-- since all terms in the first summand of line 4 are fixed, non-random -->
<!-- values conditional on $\mathbb{X}$ and the second summand is 0 by -->
<!-- assumption. If you are rusty with properties of random variables, -->
<!-- consider reviewing the material in Appendix \@ref(prob-review). -->

<!-- Using the facts above, we discuss interpretation of simple linear -->
<!-- regression models, multiple linear regression models with basic numeric -->
<!-- predictors as regressors, and interpretation for parallel and separate -->
<!-- lines regression model. -->

<!-- ### Interpretation for simple linear regression -->

<!-- Suppose we have a simple linear regression model, so that -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- E(Y\mid X)=\beta_0 + \beta_1 X. (\#eq:slr-equation) -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- The interpretations of the coefficients are: -->

<!-- -   $\beta_0$ is the expected response when the regressor is 0, i.e., -->
<!--     $\beta_0=E(Y\mid X=0)$. -->
<!-- -   $\beta_1$ is the expected change in the response when the regressor -->
<!--     increases 1 unit, i.e., $\beta_1=E(Y\mid X=x^*+1)-E(Y\mid X=x^*)$, -->
<!--     where $x^*$ is a fixed, real number. -->

<!-- Regarding the interpretation of $\beta_0$, from the regression model in -->
<!-- Equation \@ref(eq:slr-equation), notice that -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \begin{aligned} -->
<!-- E(Y\mid X = 0) &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot 0 \\ -->
<!-- &= \beta_0. -->
<!-- \end{aligned} -->
<!-- $$ This is why $\beta_0$ is the expected value of the response variable -->
<!-- when the regressor is zero. -->

<!-- Similarly, for $\beta_1$, we notice that -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \begin{aligned} -->
<!-- E(Y\mid X=x^*+1)-E(Y\mid X=x^*) &= [\beta_0 + \beta_1 (x^* + 1)] - [\beta_0 + \beta_1 x^*] \\ -->
<!-- &= \beta_1. -->
<!-- \end{aligned} -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- Thus, $\beta_1$ literally equals the change in the expected response -->
<!-- when the regressor increases by 1 unit. -->

<!-- The regressors we use in our regression analysis are often observational -->
<!-- in nature, meaning that we do not control them. And even if we could -->
<!-- control them, they may be difficult to change. E.g., if one of our -->
<!-- regressors was the size of an island, how would we realistically go -->
<!-- about increasing the size of the island? thus, in the context of -->
<!-- observational data, it may not make sense to say "we increase $X$ by 1 -->
<!-- unit" or "when $X$ increases by 1 unit". An alternative approach, -->
<!-- alluded to by @lmwr2, is to consider the expected response difference -->
<!-- between observations that are identical with respect to all regressors -->
<!-- we include in our model except the regressor under consideration, which -->
<!-- varies by only a single unit. While mathematically, the result is the -->
<!-- same, the interpretation is more philosophically palatable. Regardless, -->
<!-- interpretation is a bit of an art. There can be many correct ways to -->
<!-- interpret a coefficient or the impact of a variable. Always double-check -->
<!-- that the mathematics of our model supports our conclusions. -->

<!-- To illustrate the interpretations given above, we interpret the simple -->
<!-- linear regression model fit to the `penguins` data in Section -->
<!-- \@ref(s:penguins-slr). From Section \@ref(s:penguins-slr), the fitted -->
<!-- simple linear regression model of `bill_length_mm` regressed on -->
<!-- `body_mass_g` is -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \hat{E}(\mathtt{bill\_length\_mm}\mid \mathtt{body\_mass\_g})=26.9+0.004 (\#eq:slr-penguin-orig) \,\mathtt{body\_mass\_g}. -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- Some basic interpretations of the coefficients are: -->

<!-- -   Intercept: The expected bill length of a penguin with a body mass of -->
<!--     0 grams is 26.9 mm. We discussed the absurdity of this -->
<!--     interpretation in Section \@ref(s:penguins-slr). -->
<!-- -   `body_mass_g`: A penguin 1 gram heavier than another penguin is -->
<!--     expected to have a bill length 0.004 mm longer than the smaller -->
<!--     penguin. -->

<!-- The scale of the latter interpretation is difficult to comprehend. A -->
<!-- weight difference of 1 gram is negligible in the context of penguin -->
<!-- weights, and a bill length change of 0.004 mm is unlikely to be noticed -->
<!-- by the naked eye. This suggests that rescaling our `body_mass_g` -->
<!-- predictor could result in a more natural interpretation of the -->
<!-- associated coefficient. In the code below, we divide the `body_mass_g` -->
<!-- variable by 1000 to convert the variable from grams to kilograms, and -->
<!-- consequently, save the rescaled variable as `body_mass_kg`. We then fit -->
<!-- the model regressing `bill_length_mm` on `body_mass_kg` and extract the -->
<!-- estimated coefficients. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- # load penguins data -->
<!-- data(penguins, package = "palmerpenguins") -->
<!-- # transform body mass variable from g to kg -->
<!-- penguins <- penguins |> transform(body_mass_kg = body_mass_g/1000) -->
<!-- # fit model with body_mass_kg -->
<!-- slmod_scaled <- lm(bill_length_mm ~ body_mass_kg, data = penguins) -->
<!-- # extract coefficients -->
<!-- coefficients(slmod_scaled) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- The fitted model from above is -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \hat{E}(\mathtt{bill\_length\_mm}\mid \mathtt{body\_mass\_kg})=26.9+4.05 \,\mathtt{body\_mass\_kg}.(\#eq:slr-penguin-rescaled) -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- Thus, we can interpret the estimated coefficient for `body_mass_kg` -->
<!-- as something like, "A penguin that is 1 kg larger than another penguin -->
<!-- is expected to have a bill length 4 mm longer than the smaller penguin". -->

<!-- Comparing the estimated coefficients from Equations -->
<!-- \@ref(eq:slr-penguin-orig) and \@ref(eq:slr-penguin-rescaled), we see -->
<!-- that dividing `body_mass_g` by 1000 resulted in the estimated -->
<!-- coefficient changing by a factor of 1000. More generally, if -->
<!-- $\hat{\beta}_j$ is the estimated coefficient for $X_j$, then the -->
<!-- regressor $(X_j + a)/c$ will have an estimated coefficient of -->
<!-- $c\hat{\beta}_j$, where $a$ and $c$ are fixed, real numbers and assuming -->
<!-- nothing else in the fitted model changes. -->

<!-- ### Interpretation for first-order multiple linear regression models {#interp-1st-order-ml} -->

<!-- Suppose we have a multiple linear regression model with $p-1$ first-order regressors, so that -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- E(Y\mid X_1,\ldots,X_{p-1})=\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \cdots + \beta_{p-1} X_{p-1}.(\#eq:mlr-equation) -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- Relying on the definition of $\mathbb{X}$, we denote the set of -->
<!-- regressors without $X_j$ as -->
<!-- $\mathbb{X}_{-j} = \mathbb{X}\setminus\{X_j\}$. -->

<!-- The interpretations of the coefficients from the model in Equation -->
<!-- \@ref(eq:mlr-equation) are: -->

<!-- -   $\beta_0$ is the expected response when all regressors are 0, i.e., -->
<!--     $\beta_0=E(Y\mid X_1=0,\ldots,X_{p-1}=0)$. -->
<!-- -   $\beta_j$, $j = 1,\ldots,p-1$, represents the expected change in the -->
<!--     response when regressor $j$ increases 1 unit and the other -->
<!--     regressors stay the same, i.e., -->
<!--     $\beta_j=E(Y\mid \mathbb{X}_{-j} = \mathbf{x}^*_{-j}, X_{j+1} = x_{j}^*+1)-E(Y\mid \mathbb{X}_{-j} = \mathbf{x}^*_{-j}, X_{j+1} = x_{j}^*)$ -->
<!--     where -->
<!--     $\mathbf{x}_{-j}^*=[x^*_1,\ldots,x_{j-1}^*,x_{j+1}^*,\ldots,x_{p-1}^*]\in \mathbb{R}^{p-2}$ -->
<!--     is a vector with $p-2$ fixed values (the number of regressors -->
<!--     excluding $X_j$) and $x_j^*$ is a fixed real number. The -->
<!--     non-intercept coefficients of a multiple linear regression model are -->
<!--     known as **partial slopes**. -->

<!-- Regarding the interpretation of $\beta_0$, from the regression model in -->
<!-- Equation \@ref(eq:mlr-equation), notice that -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \begin{aligned} -->
<!-- E(Y\mid X_1=0,\ldots,X_{p-1}=0) &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot 0 + \cdots + \beta_{p-1} \cdot 0\\ -->
<!-- &= \beta_0. -->
<!-- \end{aligned} -->
<!-- $$ -->

<!-- It is quite common for the mathematical interpretation of the intercept -->
<!-- to be nonsensical because we are extrapolating outside the range of the -->
<!-- observed data. -->

<!-- For $\beta_j$, $j = 1,\ldots, p-1$, we notice that $$ -->
<!-- \begin{aligned} -->
<!-- & E(Y\mid \mathbb{X}_{-j} = \mathbf{x}^*_{-j}, X_j = x_{j}^*+1)-E(Y\mid \mathbb{X}_{-j} = \mathbf{x}^*_{-j}, X_j = x_{j}^*)\\ -->
<!-- &=  \biggl[\beta_0 + \sum_{k=1}^{j-1}\beta_kx^*_k + \beta_j(x^*_j+1) + \sum_{k=j+1}^{p-1}\beta_kx^*_k\biggl] \\ -->
<!-- &\quad -\biggl[\beta_0 + \sum_{k=1}^{j-1}\beta_kx^*_k + \beta_jx^*_j + \sum_{k=j+1}^{p-1}\beta_kx^*_k\biggl]\\ -->
<!-- &= \beta_j. -->
<!-- \end{aligned} -->
<!-- $$ -->

<!-- A notable problem with the standard mathematical interpretation of -->
<!-- multiple regression models is that a single predictor can be used more -->
<!-- than once in the model. E.g., in the 2nd-degree polynomial regression -->
<!-- model -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- E(Y\mid X) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \beta_2 X^2, -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- $X$ is used in -->
<!-- both the second and third terms. So it is not possible to increase $X$ -->
<!-- while keeping $X^2$ fixed. The mathematical interpretation given in this -->
<!-- section is applicable to first-order linear regression models (cf. -->
<!-- Section \@ref(model-types)), where a *first-order linear regression -->
<!-- model* is a multiple linear regression model in which no regressor is a -->
<!-- function of any other regressor. -->

<!-- Additionally, the interpretation given above for the partial slope -->
<!-- coefficients applies to the coefficients of numeric predictors that can -->
<!-- increase by 1 unit; that interpretation doesn't apply to the -->
<!-- coefficients for categorical predictors, which are discussed in Section -->
<!-- \@ref(interp-cat-predictor). -->

<!-- To illustrate the interpretations given above, we interpret the -->
<!-- first-order multiple linear regression model fit to the `penguins` data -->
<!-- in Section \@ref(s:penguins-mlr). The fitted multiple linear regression -->
<!-- model is -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \begin{aligned} -->
<!-- &\hat{E}(\mathtt{bill\_length\_mm}\mid \mathtt{body\_mass\_g}, \mathtt{flipper\_length\_mm})\\ -->
<!-- &=-3.44+0.0007 \,\mathtt{body\_mass\_g}+0.22\,\mathtt{flipper\_length\_mm}. -->
<!-- \end{aligned} -->
<!-- (\#eq:mlr-penguins-interp) -->
<!-- $$ -->

<!-- Some basic interpretations of the coefficients are: -->

<!-- -   Intercept: We expect a penguin with a body mass of 0 grams and a -->
<!--     flipper length of 0 mm to have a bill length of -3.44 mm. -->
<!-- -   `body_mass_g`: For two penguins that have the same flipper length but one penguin has a body mass 1 gram larger, we expect the heavier penguin to have a bill length 0.0007 mm longer than the other penguin. -->
<!-- -   `flipper_length_mm`: For two penguins with the same body mass but whose flipper lengths differ by 1 mm, we expect the penguin with longer flippers to have a bill length 0.22 mm longer than the other penguin. -->

<!-- ### Roles of regressor variables {#regressor-roles} -->

<!-- Did you notice that the estimated coefficients for the intercept and the -->
<!-- `body_mass_g` regressor changed between the fitted simple linear model -->
<!-- and the fitted multiple linear regression model for the `penguins` -->
<!-- example in the sections above (cf. Equations \@ref(eq:slr-penguin-orig) -->
<!-- and \@ref(eq:mlr-penguins-interp))? Why does this happen? What is going -->
<!-- on? -->

<!-- The role a regressor plays in a regression model depends on what other -->
<!-- regressors are in the model. Recall a team setting you've been in where -->
<!-- you had to work with others to accomplish something; it could be related -->
<!-- to school, work, sports, etc. Depending on the skills and knowledge your -->
<!-- team members have, you will try to find a role in which you can -->
<!-- effectively help the team. Something similar happens in regression -->
<!-- models. Generally, we can't provide a definitive interpretation of a -->
<!-- regressor's role in a fitted model without knowing what other regressors -->
<!-- are in the model. Thus, when interpreting a regressor, it is common to -->
<!-- include something like *after accounting for the other variables in -->
<!-- the model*. We do this because we are giving the interpretation of that -->
<!-- regressor's role when the other variables are also in the model. If our -->
<!-- model had different variables, then our interpretation would be -->
<!-- different. -->

<!-- There is also a technical reason why the estimated coefficients change -->
<!-- as we add or remove regressors from a model. If a regressor is -->
<!-- correlated with other regressors in a model, then adding or removing -->
<!-- that regressor will impact the estimated coefficients in the new model. -->
<!-- The more correlated the regressors are, the more they tend to affect -->
<!-- each others' estimated coefficients. More formally, a regressor will -->
<!-- impact the estimated coefficients of the other regressors in a model -->
<!-- unless it is **orthogonal** to the other regressors. Orthogonality is -->
<!-- related to correlation, but there are important differences. See Section -->
<!-- \@ref(orthogonality)), which provides an extensive discussion of -->
<!-- orthogonality and how it affects estimation. -->

<!-- ## Effect plots -->

<!-- An effect plot is a visual display that aids in helping us intuitively -->
<!-- interpret the impact of a *predictor* in a model. As stated by -->
<!-- @fox2020predictor: -->

<!-- > Summarization of the effects of predictors using tables of coefficient -->
<!-- > estimates is often incomplete. Effects, and particularly plots of -->
<!-- > effects, can in many instances reveal the relationship of the response -->
<!-- > to the predictors more clearly. This conclusion is especially true for -->
<!-- > models with linear predictors that include interactions and -->
<!-- > multiple-coefficient terms such as regression splines and polynomials -->
<!-- > .... -->

<!-- More formally, an **effect plot** is a plot of the estimated mean -->
<!-- response as a function of a *focal predictor* with the other -->
<!-- *predictors* being held at "typical values". The distinction between -->
<!-- predictor and regressor is important when discussing effect plots, -->
<!-- because we can create effect plots for each predictor but not -->
<!-- necessarily each regressor. Recall from Section -->
<!-- \@ref(a-simple-motivating-example) that a predictor variable is a -->
<!-- variable available to model the response variable, while a regressor -->
<!-- variable is a variable used in our regression model, whether that is an -->
<!-- unmodified predictor variable, some transformation of a predictor, some -->
<!-- combination of predictors, etc. -->
<!-- <!-- Recalling the regression models fit in Chapter @ref(linear-model-estimation), `body_mass_g`, `flipper_length_mm`, and `species` were predictor variables. Additionally, based on how we used them, `body_mass_g` and `flipper_length_mm` were also regressors in certain models. Additional regressors were `speciesChinstrap` and `speciesGentoo` (the indicator variables for Chinstrap and Gentoo penguins based on the variable `species`, respectively) and `body_mass_g:speciesChinstrap` and `body_mass_g:speciesGentoo`, the regressors created by multiplying the indicator variables with the `body_mass_g` predictor. --> -->

<!-- We first discuss how to create an effect plot for a first-order linear -->
<!-- regression models with numeric regressors since these are the simplest -->
<!-- to construct. In a first-order linear model, none of the regressors -->
<!-- interact, i.e., none of the regressors are functions of each other. -->
<!-- @fox2020predictor use the terminology **fixed group** to refer to the -->
<!-- group of predictors that do not interact with the focal predictor. For a -->
<!-- first-order regression model, all of the non-focal predictors are part -->
<!-- of the fixed group. To create our effect plot, we must first find the -->
<!-- equation for the estimated mean response as a function of a focal -->
<!-- predictor while holding the other predictors at their "typical" values. -->
<!-- We set numeric fixed group predictors equal to their sample means when -->
<!-- finding this function. -->

<!-- We now construct effect plots for the estimated regression model of the -->
<!-- `penguins` data that regressed `bill_length_mm` on `body_mass_g` and -->
<!-- `flipper_length_mm` (previously considered in Section -->
<!-- \@ref(s:penguins-mlr)). We refit that model using the code below and -->
<!-- assign it the name `mlmod`. The fitted model is -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \begin{aligned} -->
<!-- &\hat{E}(\mathtt{bill\_length\_mm}\mid \mathtt{body\_mass\_g}, \mathtt{flipper\_length\_mm})\\ -->
<!-- &=-3.44+0.0007 \,\mathtt{body\_mass\_g}+0.22\,\mathtt{flipper\_length\_mm}. -->
<!-- \end{aligned} -->
<!-- (\#eq:mlr-effect-equation) -->
<!-- $$ -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- # load penguins data since it hasn't been loaded in this chapter -->
<!-- data(penguins, package = "palmerpenguins") -->
<!-- # refit multiple linear regression model -->
<!-- mlmod <- lm(bill_length_mm ~ body_mass_g + flipper_length_mm, data = penguins) -->
<!-- # extract estimated coefficients -->
<!-- coef(mlmod) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- There are two predictors in the model in Equation -->
<!-- \@ref(eq:mlr-effect-equation), `body_mass_g` and `flipper_length_mm`, so -->
<!-- we can create effect plots for both variables. Since each predictor is -->
<!-- numeric and doesn't interact with other predictors, the "typical" value -->
<!-- used to determine the estimated mean response will be the sample mean of -->
<!-- the observed predictor values. When fitting a linear model in R, R will -->
<!-- automatically drop any observations that have `NA` values for any -->
<!-- variables used in our model. Thus, the sample means used in our effect -->
<!-- plot should correspond to the sample mean of the values actually used to -->
<!-- fit the model. If our fitted model was assigned the name `lmod`, the -->
<!-- response and predictor values used to fit the model may be extracted -->
<!-- using `lmod$model`. Since the response variable and predictor variables -->
<!-- used to fit `mlmod` are all numeric, we can use the `colMeans` function -->
<!-- to get the sample mean of each variable. The sample means of the -->
<!-- `body_mass_g` and `flipper_length_mm` values used to fit `mlmod` are -->
<!-- $\overline{\mathtt{body\_mass\_g}}=4201.75$ and -->
<!-- $\overline{\mathtt{flipper\_length\_mm}}=200.92$, respectively, as shown -->
<!-- in the code below. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- colMeans(mlmod$model) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- The effect plot for $\mathtt{body\_mass\_g}$ (on the response -->
<!-- $\mathtt{bill\_length\_mm}$) is a plot of -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \begin{aligned} -->
<!-- &\hat{E}(\mathtt{bill\_length\_mm}\mid \mathtt{body\_mass\_g}, \mathtt{flipper\_length\_mm} = 200.92)\\ -->
<!-- &=-3.44+0.0007 \,\mathtt{body\_mass\_g}+0.22\cdot 200.92 \\ -->
<!-- &=41.14+0.0007 \,\mathtt{body\_mass\_g} -->
<!-- \end{aligned} -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- as a function of $\mathtt{body\_mass\_g}$. Note: we used exact values -->
<!-- in the calculation above. The intercept will be 40.76 instead of 41.14 -->
<!-- if we use the rounded values. Similarly, the effect plot for -->
<!-- $\mathtt{flipper\_length\_mm}$ is a plot of -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \begin{aligned} -->
<!-- &\hat{E}(\mathtt{bill\_length\_mm}\mid \mathtt{body\_mass\_g} = 4201.75,\mathtt{flipper\_length\_mm}) \\ -->
<!-- &=-3.44+0.0007 \cdot 4201.75+0.22\,\mathtt{flipper\_length\_mm} \\ -->
<!-- &=-0.65 + 0.22\,\mathtt{flipper\_length\_mm} -->
<!-- \end{aligned} -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- as a function of $\mathtt{flipper\_length\_mm}$. -->

<!-- The **`effects`** package [@R-effects] can be used to generate effect -->
<!-- plots for the predictors of a fitted linear model. We start by using the -->
<!-- `effects::predictorEffect` function to compute the information needed to -->
<!-- draw the plot, then the `plot` function to display the information. -->

<!-- The `predictorEffect` function computes the estimated mean response for -->
<!-- different values of the focal predictor while holding the other -->
<!-- predictors at their typical values. The main arguments of -->
<!-- `predictorEffect` are: -->

<!-- -   `predictor`: the name of the predictor we want to plot. This is the -->
<!--     "focal predictor". -->
<!-- -   `mod`: the fitted model. The function works with `lm` objects and many other types of fitted models. -->

<!-- The `plot` function will take the output of the `predictorEffect` -->
<!-- function and produce the desired effect plot. -->

<!-- In the code below, we load the **`effects`** package (so that we can use -->
<!-- the `predictorEffect` function) and then combine calls to the `plot` and -->
<!-- `predictorEffect` functions to create an effect plot for `body_mass_g`, -->
<!-- which is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:effect-plot-body-mass). -->

<!-- ```{r effect-plot-body-mass, fig.cap = "Effect plot for body mass based on the fitted model in Equation \\@ref(eq:mlr-effect-equation)."} -->
<!-- # load effects package -->
<!-- library(effects) -->
<!-- # draw effect plot for body_mass_g -->
<!-- plot(predictorEffect("body_mass_g", mlmod)) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- We see from Figure \@ref(fig:effect-plot-body-mass) that there is a -->
<!-- clear positive association between `body_mass_g` and `bill_length_mm` -->
<!-- after accounting for the `flipper_length_mm` variable. The shaded area -->
<!-- indicates the 95% confidence interval bands for the estimated mean -->
<!-- response. We do not discuss confidence interval bands here, except to -->
<!-- say that they provide a visual picture of the uncertainty of our -->
<!-- estimated mean (wider bands indicate greater uncertainty). Chapter -->
<!-- \@ref(inference) discusses confidence intervals for linear models in -->
<!-- some detail. The many tick marks along the the x-axis of the effect plot -->
<!-- indicate observed values of the x-axis variable. -->

<!-- We next create an effect plot for `flipper_length_mm`, which is shown in -->
<!-- Figure \@ref(fig:effect-plot-flipper-length), using the code below. -->
<!-- There is a clear positive association between `flipper_length_mm` and -->
<!-- `bill_length_mm` after accounting for `body_mass_g`. -->

<!-- ```{r effect-plot-flipper-length, fig.cap = "Effect plot for flipper length based on the fitted model in Equation \\@ref(eq:mlr-effect-equation)."} -->
<!-- # draw effect plot for flipper_length_mm -->
<!-- plot(predictorEffect("flipper_length_mm", mlmod)) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Alternatively, we could use `effects::allEffects` to compute the -->
<!-- necessary effect plot information for all predictors simultaneously, -->
<!-- then use `plot` to create a display of the effect plots for all -->
<!-- predictors in one graphic. This approach is quicker, but the individual -->
<!-- effect plots can sometimes be too small for practical use. We -->
<!-- demonstrate this faster approach in the code below, which produces -->
<!-- Figure \@ref(fig:mlmod-effect-plots-all). -->

<!-- ```{r mlmod-effect-plots-all, fig.cap = "All effect plots for predictors of the fitted model in Equation \\@ref(eq:mlr-effect-equation)."} -->
<!-- plot(allEffects(mlmod)) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## Interpretation for categorical predictors {#interp-cat-predictor} -->

<!-- We now discuss the interpretation of regression coefficients in the -->
<!-- context of a parallel lines and separate lines models. -->

<!-- ### Coefficient interpretation for parallel lines models {#pl-interp} -->

<!-- Consider a parallel lines model with numeric regressor $X$ and -->
<!-- categorical predictor $C$ with levels $L_1$, $L_2$, and $L_3$. Following -->
<!-- the discussion in Section \@ref(categorical-predictors), predictor $C$ -->
<!-- must be transformed into two indicator variables, $D_2$ and $D_3$, for -->
<!-- category levels $L_2$ and $L_3$, to be included in our linear model. -->
<!-- $L_1$ is the reference level. The parallel lines model is formulated as -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- E(Y \mid X, C) = \beta_{int} + \beta_{X} X + \beta_{L_2} D_2 +  \beta_{L_3} D_3, (\#eq:pl-def-interp) -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- where we replace the usual $\beta_0$, $\beta_1$, $\beta_2$, and -->
<!-- $\beta_3$ with notation the indicates the regressor each coefficient is -->
<!-- associated with. -->

<!-- When an observation has level $L_1$ and $X=0$, then the expected -->
<!-- response is -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \begin{aligned} -->
<!-- E(Y|X = 0, C=L_1) &= \beta_{int} + \beta_X \cdot 0 + \beta_{L_2} \cdot 0 + \beta_{L_3} \cdot 0 \\ -->
<!-- &= \beta_{int}. -->
<!-- \end{aligned} -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- Thus, $\beta_{int}$ is the expected response for an observation with -->
<!-- level $L_1$ when $X=0$. -->

<!-- When an observation has a fixed level $L_j$ (it doesn't matter which -->
<!-- level) and $X$ increases from $x^*$ to $x^*+1$, then the change in the -->
<!-- expected response is -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- E(Y|X = x^* + 1, C=L_j) - E(Y|X = x^*, C=L_j)= \beta_X. -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- Thus, $\beta_X$ is the expected change in the response for an -->
<!-- observation with fixed level $L_j$ when $X$ increases by 1 unit. -->

<!-- When an observation has level $L_2$, the expected response is -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \begin{aligned} -->
<!-- E(Y\mid X = x^*, C=L_2) &= \beta_{int} + \beta_X x^* + \beta_{L_2} \cdot 1 + \beta_{L_3} \cdot 0 \\ -->
<!-- &= \beta_{int} + \beta_X x^* + \beta_{L_2}. -->
<!-- \end{aligned} -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- Thus, -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \begin{aligned} -->
<!-- & E(Y\mid X=x^*, C=L_2) - E(Y\mid X=x^*, C=L_1) \\ -->
<!-- &= (\beta_{int} + \beta_X x^* + \beta_{L_2}) - (\beta_{int} + \beta_X x^*) \\ -->
<!-- &=  \beta_{L_2}. -->
<!-- \end{aligned} -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- Thus, $\beta_{L_2}$ is the expected change in the response for a -->
<!-- fixed value of $X$ when comparing on observation having level $L_1$ to -->
<!-- level $L_2$ of predictor $C$. More specifically, $\beta_{L_2}$ indicates -->
<!-- the distance between the estimated regression lines for observations -->
<!-- having levels $L_1$ and $L_2$. A similar interpretation holds for -->
<!-- $\beta_{L_3}$ when comparing observations having level $L_3$ to -->
<!-- observations having level $L_1$. $L_1$ is known as as the reference -->
<!-- level of $C$ because we must refer to it to interpret our model with -->
<!-- respect to other levels of $C$. -->

<!-- To summarize the interpretation of the coefficients in parallel lines -->
<!-- models like Equation \@ref(eq:pl-def-interp), assuming categorical -->
<!-- predictor $C$ has $K$ levels instead of 3: -->

<!-- -   $\beta_{int}$ represents the expected response for observations -->
<!--     having the reference level when the numeric regressor $X = 0$. -->
<!-- -   $\beta_X$ is the expected change in the response when $X$ increases -->
<!--     by 1 unit for a fixed level of $C$. -->
<!-- -   $\beta_{L_j}$, for $j=2,\ldots,K$, represents the expected change in -->
<!--     the response when comparing observations having level $L_1$ and -->
<!--     $L_j$ with $X$ fixed at the same value. -->

<!-- In Section \@ref(s:penguins-mlr2), we fit a parallel lines model to the -->
<!-- `penguins` data that used both `body_mass_g` and `species` to explain -->
<!-- the behavior of `bill_length_mm`. Letting $D_C$ denote the indicator -->
<!-- variable for the `Chinstrap` level and $D_G$ denote the indicator -->
<!-- variable for the `Gentoo` level, the fitted parallel lines model was -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \begin{aligned} -->
<!-- &\hat{E}(\mathtt{bill\_length\_mm} \mid \mathtt{body\_mass\_g}, \mathtt{species})\\ -->
<!-- &= 24.92 + 0.004 \mathtt{body\_mass\_g} + 9.92 D_C + 3.56 D_G. -->
<!-- \end{aligned} -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- In the context of this model: -->

<!-- -   The expected bill length for an Adelie penguin with a body mass of 0 -->
<!--     grams is 24.92 mm. -->
<!-- -   If two penguins are of the same species, but one penguin has a body -->
<!--     mass 1 gram larger, then the larger penguin is expected to have a -->
<!--     bill length 0.004 mm longer than the smaller penguin. -->
<!-- -   A Chinstrap penguin is expected to have a bill length 9.92 mm longer -->
<!--     than an Adelie penguin, assuming their body mass is the same. -->
<!-- -   A Gentoo penguin is expected to have a bill length 3.56 mm longer -->
<!--     than an Adelie penguin, assuming their body mass is the same. -->

<!-- ### Effect plots for fitted models with non-interacting categorical predictors -->

<!-- How do we create an effect plot for a numeric focal predictor when a -->
<!-- non-interacting categorical predictor is in the model (such as for the -->
<!-- parallel lines model we have been discussing)? In short, we determine -->
<!-- the fitted model equation as a function of the focal predictor for each level of -->
<!-- the categorical predictor, and then compute the weighted average of the -->
<!-- equation with the weights being proportional to the number of -->
<!-- observations in each group. -->

<!-- Let's construct an effect plot for the `body_mass_g` predictor in the -->
<!-- context of the `penguins` parallel lines model discussed in the previous -->
<!-- section. In Section \@ref(s:penguins-mlr2), we determined that the -->
<!-- fitted parallel lines model simplified to the following equations -->
<!-- depending on the level of `species`: -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \begin{aligned} -->
<!-- &\hat{E}(\mathtt{bill\_length\_mm} \mid \mathtt{body\_mass\_g}, \mathtt{species}=\mathtt{Adelie}) \\ -->
<!-- &= 24.92 + 0.004 \mathtt{body\_mass\_g} \\ -->
<!-- &\hat{E}(\mathtt{bill\_length\_mm} \mid \mathtt{body\_mass\_g}, \mathtt{species}=\mathtt{Chinstrap}) \\ -->
<!-- &= 34.84 + 0.004 \mathtt{body\_mass\_g} \\ -->
<!-- &\hat{E}(\mathtt{bill\_length\_mm} \mid \mathtt{body\_mass\_g}, \mathtt{species}=\mathtt{Gentoo}) \\ -->
<!-- &= 28.48 + 0.004 \mathtt{body\_mass\_g}. -->
<!-- \end{aligned} -->
<!-- (\#eq:pl-equations) -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- We recreate the fitted model producing these equations in R using the -->
<!-- code below. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- # refit the parallel lines model -->
<!-- lmodp <- lm(bill_length_mm ~ body_mass_g + species, data = penguins) -->
<!-- # double-check coefficients -->
<!-- coef(lmodp) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- The code below determines the number of observations with each level of -->
<!-- `species` for the data used in the fitted model `lmodp`. We see that 151 -->
<!-- Adelie, 68 Chinstrap, and 123 Gentoo penguins (342 total penguins) were -->
<!-- used to fit the model stored in `lmodp`. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- table(lmodp$model$species) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- The equation used to create the effect plot of `body_mass_g` is the -->
<!-- weighted average of the equations in Equation \@ref(eq:pl-equations), -->
<!-- with weights proportional to the number of observational having each -->
<!-- level of the categorical predictor. Specifically, -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \begin{aligned} -->
<!-- & \hat{E}(\mathtt{bill\_length\_mm} \mid \mathtt{body\_mass\_g}, \mathtt{species}=\mathtt{typical}) \\ -->
<!-- &= \frac{151}{342}(24.92 + 0.004 \mathtt{body\_mass\_g})\\ -->
<!-- &\quad + \frac{68}{342}(34.84 + 0.004 \mathtt{body\_mass\_g})\\ -->
<!-- &\quad + \frac{123}{342}(28.48 + 0.004 \mathtt{body\_mass\_g}) \\ -->
<!-- &=28.17 + 0.004 \mathtt{body\_mass\_g}. -->
<!-- \end{aligned} -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- The effect plot for `body_mass_g` for the fitted parallel lines model -->
<!-- is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:effect-plot-plmod-body-mass). The -->
<!-- association between `bill_length_mm` and `body_mass_g` is positive after -->
<!-- accounting for `species`. -->

<!-- ```{r effect-plot-plmod-body-mass, fig.cap="The effect plot of `body_mass_g` for the fitted parallel lines model."} -->
<!-- # draw effect plot for body_mass_g -->
<!-- plot(predictorEffect("body_mass_g", lmodp)) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- <!-- Alternatively, if we want to see the effect plot for `body_mass_g` for each level of the categorical predictors, then we can use the `multiline` argument of the `plot` function to get the desired result. We use the code below to produce Figure @ref(fig:eff-plot-pl-multiline).  --> -->

<!-- <!-- ```{r eff-plot-pl-multiline, fig.cap="An effect plot of `body_mass_g` that distinguishes the effect for each level of `species`."} --> -->

<!-- <!-- plot(predictorEffect("body_mass_g", lmodp),  lines=TRUE) --> -->

<!-- <!-- ``` --> -->

<!-- An effect plot for a categorical predictor, assuming all other -->
<!-- predictors in the model are non-interacting numerical predictors (i.e., -->
<!-- fixed group predictors), is a plot of the estimated mean response for -->
<!-- each level of the categorical variable when the fixed group group -->
<!-- predictors are held at their sample mean. The sample mean of the -->
<!-- `body_mass_g` values used to fit `lmodp` is 4201.75, as shown in the -->
<!-- code below. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- # sample mean of body_mass_g variable used to fit lmodp -->
<!-- mean(lmodp$model$body_mass_g) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Using the first equation in Equation \@ref(eq:pl-equations), the -->
<!-- estimated mean for the Adelie species when `body_mass_g` is fixed at -->
<!-- 4201.75 is -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \begin{aligned} -->
<!-- &\hat{E}(\mathtt{bill\_length\_mm} \mid \mathtt{body\_mass\_g} = 4201.75, \mathtt{species}=\mathtt{Adelie}) \\ -->
<!-- &= 24.92 + 0.004 \cdot 4201.75 \\ -->
<!-- &= 40.67. -->
<!-- \end{aligned} -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- Similarly, -->
<!-- $\hat{E}(\mathtt{bill\_length\_mm} \mid \mathtt{body\_mass\_g} = 4201.75, \mathtt{species}=\mathtt{Chinstrap}) = 50.59$ -->
<!-- and -->
<!-- $\hat{E}(\mathtt{bill\_length\_mm} \mid \mathtt{body\_mass\_g} = 4201.75, \mathtt{species}=\mathtt{Gentoo}) = 44.23$. -->

<!-- The code below produces the effect plot for `species`, which is shown in -->
<!-- Figure \@ref(fig:eff-plot-species-plmod). We see that after accounting -->
<!-- for `body_mass_g`, the `bill_length_mm` tends to be largest for -->
<!-- Chinstrap penguins, second largest for Gentoo penguins, and smallest for -->
<!-- Adelie penguins. The confidence bands for the estimated mean response -->
<!-- are shown by the vertical bars. -->

<!-- ```{r eff-plot-species-plmod, fig.cap = "An effect plot for `species` after accounting for `body_mass_g`."} -->
<!-- plot(predictorEffect("species", lmodp)) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ### Coefficient interpretation for separate lines models {#sl-interp} -->

<!-- Consider a separate lines model with numeric regressor $X$ and -->
<!-- categorical predictor $C$ with levels $L_1$, $L_2$, and $L_3$. The -->
<!-- predictor $C$ will be transformed into two indicator variables, $D_2$ -->
<!-- and $D_3$, for category levels $L_2$ and $L_3$, with $L_1$ being the -->
<!-- reference level. The separate lines model is formulated as -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- E(Y \mid X, C) = \beta_{int} + \beta_{X} X + \beta_{L_2} D_2 +  \beta_{L_3} D_3 + \beta_{XL_2} XD_2+\beta_{XL_3}XD_3. (\#eq:sl-def-interp) -->
<!-- $$ -->

<!-- When an observation has level $L_1$ and $X=x^*$, then the expected -->
<!-- response is -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \begin{aligned} -->
<!-- &E(Y\mid X = x^*, C=L_1) \\ -->
<!-- &= \beta_{int} + \beta_X \cdot x^* + \beta_{L_2} \cdot 0 + \beta_{L_3} \cdot 0  + \beta_{X L_2} \cdot x^* \cdot 0 + \beta_{X L_3}\cdot x^* \cdot 0 \\ -->
<!-- &= \beta_{int} + \beta_X x^*. -->
<!-- \end{aligned} -->
<!-- (\#eq:slr-mean-L1) -->
<!-- $$ -->

<!-- Using Equation \@ref(eq:slr-mean-L1), we can verify that: -->

<!-- -   $\beta_{int} = E(Y\mid X = 0, C=L_1)$. -->
<!-- -   $\beta_{X} = E(Y\mid X = x^* + 1, C=L_1) - E(Y\mid X = x^*, C=L_1)$. -->

<!-- Similarly, when $C=L_2$, -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \begin{aligned} -->
<!-- & E(Y|X = x^*, C=L_2) \\ -->
<!-- &= \beta_{int} + \beta_X \cdot x^* + \beta_{L_2} \cdot 1 + \beta_{L_3} \cdot 0  + \beta_{X L_2} \cdot x^* \cdot 1 + \beta_{X L_3}\cdot x^* \cdot 0 \\ -->
<!-- &= \beta_{int} + \beta_X x^* + \beta_{L_2} + \beta_{XL_2}x^*\\ -->
<!-- &= (\beta_{int} + \beta_{L_2}) + (\beta_X + \beta_{XL_2})x^*. -->
<!-- \end{aligned} -->
<!-- (\#eq:slr-mean-L2) -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- Following this same pattern, when $C=L_3$ we have -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- E(Y|X = x^*, C=L_3) = (\beta_{int} + \beta_{L_3}) + (\beta_X + \beta_{XL_3})x^*. (\#eq:slr-mean-L3) -->
<!-- $$ -->

<!-- Using Equations \@ref(eq:slr-mean-L1), \@ref(eq:slr-mean-L2), and -->
<!-- \@ref(eq:slr-mean-L3), we can verify that for $j=2,3$, -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \beta_{L_j}= E(Y\mid X = 0, C=L_j) - E(Y\mid X = 0, C=L_1), -->

<!-- \begin{aligned} -->

<!-- &\quad-[E(Y\mid X = x^*+1, C=L_1) - E(Y\mid X = x^*, C=L_1)]. -->
<!-- \end{aligned} -->
<!-- $$ -->

<!-- To summarize the interpretation of the coefficients in separate lines -->
<!-- models like Equation \@ref(eq:sl-def-interp), assuming categorical -->
<!-- predictor $C$ has $K$ levels instead of 3: -->

<!-- -   $\beta_{int}$ represents the expected response for observations -->
<!--     having the reference level when the numeric regressor $X = 0$. -->
<!-- -   $\beta_{L_j}$, for $j=2,\ldots,K$, represents the expected change in -->
<!--     the response when comparing observations having level $L_1$ and -->
<!--     $L_j$ with $X=0$. -->
<!-- -   $\beta_X$ represents the expected change in the response when $X$ -->
<!--     increases by 1 unit for observations having the reference level. -->
<!-- -   $\beta_{X L_j}$, for $j=2,\ldots,K$, represents the difference in the -->
<!--     expected response between observations having the reference level in -->
<!--     comparison to level $L_j$ when $X$ increases by 1 unit. More simply, -->
<!--     these terms represent the difference in the rate of change for -->
<!--     observations having level $L_j$ compared to the reference level. -->

<!-- We illustrate these interpretation using the separate lines model to the -->
<!-- `penguins` data in Section \@ref(s:penguins-mlr2). The fitted -->
<!-- separate lines model was -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \begin{aligned} -->
<!-- &\hat{E}(\mathtt{bill\_length\_mm} \mid \mathtt{body\_mass\_g}, \mathtt{species}) \\ -->
<!-- &= 26.99 + 0.003 \mathtt{body\_mass\_g} + 5.18 D_C - 0.25 D_G \\ -->
<!-- &\quad + 0.001 D_C \mathtt{body\_mass\_g} + 0.0009 D_G \mathtt{body\_mass\_g}. -->
<!-- \end{aligned} -->
<!-- (\#eq:sl-refit-interp) -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- In the context of this model: -->

<!-- -   The expected bill length for an Adelie penguin with a body mass of 0 -->
<!--     grams is 26.99 mm. -->
<!-- -   If an Adelie penguin has a body mass 1 gram larger than another -->
<!--     Adelie penguin, then the larger penguin is expected to have a bill -->
<!--     length 0.003 mm longer than the smaller penguin. -->
<!-- -   A Chinstrap penguin is expected to have a bill length 5.18 mm longer -->
<!--     than an Adelie penguin when both have a body mass of 0 grams. -->
<!-- -   A Gentoo penguin is expected to have a bill length 0.25 mm shorter -->
<!--     than an Adelie penguin when both have a body mass of 0 grams. -->
<!-- -   For each 1 gram increase in body mass, we expect the change in bill -->
<!--     length by Chinstrap penguins to be 0.001 mm larger than the -->
<!--     corresponding change in bill length by Adelie penguins. -->
<!-- -   For each 1 gram increase in body mass, we expect the change in bill -->
<!--     length by Gentoo penguins to be 0.0009 mm larger than the -->
<!--     corresponding change in bill length by Adelie penguins. -->

<!-- ### Effect plots for interacting categorical predictors -->

<!-- We now discuss construction of effect plots for a separate lines model, -->
<!-- which has an interaction between a categorical and numeric predictor. In -->
<!-- additional to the focal and fixed group predictors we have previously -->
<!-- discussed, @fox2020predictor also discuss predictors in the -->
<!-- **conditioning group**, which is the set of predictors that interact -->
<!-- with the focal predictor. -->

<!-- When some predictors interact with the focal predictor, the effect plot -->
<!-- of the focal predictor is a plot of the estimated mean response when the -->
<!-- fixed group predictors are held at their typical values and the -->
<!-- conditioning group predictors vary over different combinations of -->
<!-- discrete values. The process of determining the estimated mean response -->
<!-- as function of the focal predictor is similar to before, but there are -->
<!-- more predictor values on which to condition. By default, to compute the -->
<!-- estimated mean response as a function of the focal predictor, we: -->

<!-- -   Hold the numeric fixed group predictors at their sample means. -->
<!-- -   Average the estimated mean response equation across the different -->
<!--     levels of a fixed group categorical predictor, with weights equal to -->
<!--     the number of observations with each level. -->
<!-- -   Compute the estimated mean response function for 5 discrete -->
<!--     values of numeric predictors in the conditioning group. -->
<!-- -   Compute the estimated mean response function for different levels -->
<!--     of a categorical predictor in the conditioning group. -->

<!-- We provide examples of the effect plots for the `body_mass_g` and -->
<!-- `species` predictors for the separate lines model fit to the `penguins` -->
<!-- data and given in Equation \@ref(eq:sl-refit-interp). We first run the -->
<!-- code below to fit the separate lines model previously fit in Section -->
<!-- \@ref(s:penguins-mlr2). -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- # fit separate lines model -->
<!-- lmods <- lm(bill_length_mm ~ body_mass_g + species + body_mass_g:species, -->
<!--             data = penguins) -->
<!-- # extract estimated coefficients -->
<!-- coef(lmods) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- We previously determined in Section \@ref(s:penguins-mlr2) that the -->
<!-- model simplifies depending on the level of species. Specifically, we -->
<!-- have that -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \begin{aligned} -->
<!-- &\hat{E}(\mathtt{bill\_length\_mm} \mid \mathtt{body\_mass\_g}, \mathtt{species}=\mathtt{Adelie}) \\ -->
<!-- &= 26.99 + 0.003 \mathtt{body\_mass\_g},\\ -->
<!-- &\hat{E}(\mathtt{bill\_length\_mm} \mid \mathtt{body\_mass\_g}, \mathtt{species}=\mathtt{Chinstrap}) \\ -->

<!-- &= 26.74 + 0.004 \mathtt{body\_mass\_g}. -->
<!-- \end{aligned} -->
<!-- (\#eq:separate-lines-equations-effects-plot) -->
<!-- $$ -->

<!-- The effect plot of `body_mass_g` for the separate lines model will be a -->
<!-- plot of each equation given in Equation -->
<!-- \@ref(eq:separate-lines-equations-effects-plot). Figure -->
<!-- \@ref(fig:effect-plot-body-mass-lmods) displays this effect plot, which -->
<!-- was created using the code below. We use the `axes` argument to rotate -->
<!-- the x-axis labels (otherwise the text overlaps) and the `lines` -->
<!-- argument to display all three lines in one graphic instead of a -->
<!-- separate panel for each level of `species`. We notice Chinstrap penguins -->
<!-- tend to have the largest bill lengths for a given value of body mass and -->
<!-- the bill lengths increase more quickly as a function of body mass then -->
<!-- for the Adelie and Gentoo penguins. Similarly, the Adelie penguins tend -->
<!-- to have the smallest bill length for a fixed value of body mass and the -->
<!-- bill length tends to increase more slowly as body mass increases -->
<!-- compared to the other two types of penguins. -->

<!-- `body_mass_g` over 5 discrete values. When varying `body_mass_g` across -->
<!-- the values 2700, 3600, 4500, 5300, and 6300 g, we see greater changes in -->

<!-- ## Added-variable and leverage plots -->

<!-- In this section, we will use visual displays to assess the impact of a predictor after accounting for the impact of other preditors already in the model. -->

<!-- An **added-variable plot** or **partial regression plot** displays the -->
<!-- marginal effect of a regressor on the response after accounting for the -->
<!-- other regressors in the model [@mt1977]. While an effect plot is a plot -->
<!-- of the estimated mean relationship between the response and a focal -->
<!-- predictor while holding the model's predictors at typical values, the -->
<!-- added-variable plot is a plot of two sets of residuals against one -->
<!-- other. -->

<!-- We create an added-variable plot for regressor $X_j$ in the following -->
<!-- way: -->

<!-- 1.  Compute the residuals of the model regressing the response $Y$ on -->
<!--     all regressors except $X_j$. We denote these residuals -->
<!--     $\hat{\boldsymbol{\epsilon}}(Y\mid \mathbb{X}_{-j})$. These -->
<!--     residuals represent the part of the response variable not explained -->
<!--     by the regressors in $\mathbb{X}_{-j}$. -->
<!-- 2.  Compute the residuals of the model regressing the regressor $X_j$ on -->
<!--     all regressors except $X_j$. We denote these residuals -->
<!--     $\hat{\boldsymbol{\epsilon}}(X_j \mid \mathbb{X}_{-j})$. These -->
<!--     residuals represent the part of the $X_j$ not explained by the -->
<!--     regressors in $\mathbb{X}_{-j}$. Alternatively, these residuals -->
<!--     represent the amount of additional information $X_j$ provides after -->
<!--     accounting for the regressors in $\mathbb{X}_{-j}$. -->
<!-- 3.  The added-variable plot for $X_j$ is a plot of -->
<!--     $\hat{\boldsymbol{\epsilon}}(Y\mid \mathbb{X}_{-j})$ on the y-axis -->
<!--     and $\hat{\boldsymbol{\epsilon}}(X_j \mid \mathbb{X}_{-j})$ on the -->
<!--     x-axis. -->

<!-- Added-variable plots allow us to visualize the impact a regressor has -->
<!-- when added to an existing regression model. We can use the -->
<!-- added-variable plot for $X_j$ to visually estimate the partial slope -->
<!-- $\hat{\beta}_{j}$ [@sheather2009modern]. In fact, the simple linear -->
<!-- regression line that minimizes the RSS for the added-variable plot of -->
<!-- $X_j$ will have slope $\hat{\beta}_j$. -->

<!-- We can use an added-variable plot in several ways: -->

<!-- 1.  To assess the marginal relationship between $X_j$ and $Y$ after -->
<!--     accounting for all of the other variables in the model. -->
<!-- 2.  To assess the strength of this marginal relationship. -->
<!-- 3.  To identify deficiencies in our fitted model. -->
<!-- 4.  To identify outliers and observations influential in determining the estimated partial slope. -->

<!-- We focus on points 1 and 2 above, as they are directly related to -->
<!-- interpreting our fitted model. We discuss points 3 and 4 in the context of diagnostics for assessing the appropriateness of our model. -->

<!-- In regards to point 1 and 2: -->

<!-- -   If the added-variable plot for $X_j$ is essentially a scatter of points with slope zero, then $X_j$ can do little to explain $Y$ after accounting for the other regressors. There is little to gain -->
<!-- in adding $X_j$ as an additional regressor to the model regressing -->
<!-- $Y$ on $\mathbb{X}_{-j}$. Figure \@ref(fig:avplot-examples) (a) -->
<!-- provides an example of this situation. -->
<!-- -   If the points in an added-variable plot for $X_j$ have a linear relationship, then adding $X_j$ to the model regressing $Y$ on $\mathbb{X}_{-j}$ is expected to improve our model's ability to predict the behavior of $Y$. The stronger the linear relationship of the points in the added-variable plot, the more important this -->
<!--  variable tends to be in our model. Figure \@ref(fig:avplot-examples) (b) demonstrates this scenario. -->

<!-- In regard to point 3, if the points in an added-variable plot for $X_j$ are curved or non-linear, it indicates that that there is a deficiency in the fitted model (likely because we need to include one or more additional regressors to the model). Figure \@ref(fig:avplot-examples) (c) provides an example of this situation. -->

<!-- The **`car`** package [@R-car] provides the `avPlot` and `avPlots` -->
<!-- functions for creating added-variable plots. The `avPlot` function will -->
<!-- produce an added-variable plot for a single regressor while the -->
<!-- `avPlots` function will produce added-variable plots for one or more -->
<!-- regressors. -->

<!-- The main arguments to the `avPlot` function are: -->

<!-- -   `model`: the fitted `lm` (or `glm`) object. -->

<!-- -   `variable`: the regressor for which to create an added-variable -->
<!--     plot. -->

<!-- -   `id`: a logical value indicating whether unusual observations should -->
<!--     be identified. By default, the value is `TRUE`, which means the 2 -->
<!--     points with the largest residuals and the 2 points with the largest -->
<!--     partial leverage are identified, though this can be customized. -->

<!-- The `avPlots` function replaces the `variable` argument with the `terms` -->
<!-- argument. The `terms` argument should be a one-sided formula to indicate -->
<!-- the regressors for which we want to construct added-variable plots (one -->
<!-- plot for each term). By default, an added-variable plot is created for -->
<!-- each regressor. Run `car::avPlot` in the Console for information about -->
<!-- about the arguments and details of the `avPlot` and `avPlots` functions. -->

<!-- We now create and interpret added-variable plots for the model -->
<!-- regressing `bill_length_mm` on `body_mass_g` and `flipper_length_mm`, -->
<!-- which was previously assigned the name `mlmod`. We first load the -->
<!-- **`car`** package and then use the `avPlots` function to construct -->
<!-- added-variable plots for `body_mass_g` and `flipper_length_mm`. Figure -->
<!-- \@ref(fig:avplots-mlmod) displays the added-variable plots for -->
<!-- `body_mass_g` and `flipper_length_mm`. The blue line is the simple -->
<!-- linear regression model that minimizes the RSS of the points. The -->
<!-- added-variable plot for `body_mass_g` exhibits a weak positive linear -->
<!-- relationship between the points. After using the `flipper_length_mm` -->
<!-- variable to explain the behavior of `bill_length_mm`, `body_mass_g` -->
<!-- likely has some additional explanatory power, but it doesn't explain a -->
<!-- lot of additional response variation. The added-variable plot for -->
<!-- `flipper_length_mm` exhibits a slightly stronger positive linear -->
<!-- relationship. The `flipper_length_mm` variable seems to have some -->
<!-- additional explanatory power when added to the model regressing -->
<!-- `bill_length_mm` on `body_mass_g`. -->

<!-- ```{r avplots-mlmod, fig.cap = "The added-variable plots of all regressors for the model regressing `bill_length_mm` on `body_mass_g` and `flipper_length_mm`."} -->
<!-- library(car) -->
<!-- # create added-variable plots for all regressors in mlmod -->
<!-- avPlots(mlmod) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- The added-variable plots of fitted models with categorical predictors -->
<!-- often show "clusters" of points related to the categorical predictors. -->
<!-- These clusters aren't anything to worry about unless the overall pattern -->
<!-- of the points is non-linear. We use the code below to create the -->
<!-- added-variable plots for all regressors in the parallel lines model -->
<!-- previously fit to the `penguins` data. The fitted model was -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \begin{aligned} -->
<!-- &\hat{E}(\mathtt{bill\_length\_mm} \mid \mathtt{body\_mass\_g}, \mathtt{species})\\ -->
<!-- &= 24.92 + 0.004 \mathtt{body\_mass\_g} + 9.92 D_C + 3.56 D_G, -->
<!-- \end{aligned} -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- where $D_C$ and $D_G$ are indicator variables for the Chinstrap and -->
<!-- Gentoo penguin species (Adelie penguins are the reference species). -->
<!-- Figure \@ref(fig:avplots-lmodp) displays the added-variable plots for -->
<!-- the `body_mass_g` regressor and the indicator variables for Chinstrap -->
<!-- and Gentoo penguins. The added-variable plot for `body_mass_g` has a -->
<!-- moderately strong linear relationship, so adding `body_mass_g` to the -->
<!-- model regressing `bill_length_mm` on `species` seems to be beneficial. -->
<!-- The other two variable plots also show a linear relationship. Clustering -->
<!-- patterns are apparent in the added-variable plot for the Chinstrap -->
<!-- penguins indicator variable (`speciesChinstrap`) but not for the Gentoo -->
<!-- penguins indicator variable. -->

<!-- ```{r avplots-lmodp, fig.cap = "The added-variable plots for all regressors in the parallel lines model fit to the `penguins` data."} -->
<!-- avPlots(lmodp) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- A challenge in interpreting the added-variable plots of indicator -->
<!-- variable regressors is that it often doesn't make sense to talk about -->
<!-- the effect of adding a single regressor when all of the other -->
<!-- regressors are in the model. Specifically, we either add the categorical -->
<!-- *predictor* to our regression model or we do not. When we add a -->
<!-- categorical predictor to our model, we simultaneously add $K-1$ -->
<!-- indicator variables as regressors; we do not add the indicator variables -->
<!-- one-at-a-time. In general, we refer to regressors with this behavior as -->
<!-- "multiple degrees-of-freedom terms". A categorical variable with 3 or -->
<!-- more levels is the most basic of multiple degrees-of-freedom term, but -->
<!-- we can also consider regressors related to the interaction between -->
<!-- two or more predictors, polynomial regressors, etc. -->

<!-- A **leverage plot** is an extension of the added-variable plot that -->
<!-- allows us to visualize the impact of multiple degrees-of-freedom terms. -->
<!-- @sall1990leverage originally proposed leverage plots to visualize -->
<!-- hypothesis tests of linear hypotheses. The interpretation of leverage -->
<!-- plots is similar to the interpretation of added-variable plots, though -->
<!-- we refer to "predictors" or "terms" instead regressors (which may be -->
<!-- combined into one plot). The `leveragePlot` and `leveragePlots` -->
<!-- functions in the **`car`** package produce single or multiple leverage -->
<!-- plots, respectively, with arguments similar to the `avPlot` and -->
<!-- `avPlots` functions. -->

<!-- We use the code below to create Figure \@ref(fig:leverageplot-lmodp), -->
<!-- which displays leverage plots for the `body_mass_g` and `species` -->
<!-- predictors of the parallel lines model previously fit to the `penguins` -->
<!-- data. The leverage plot for `body_mass_g` has a moderate linear -->
<!-- relationship, so we expect `body_mass_g` to have moderate value in -->
<!-- explaining the behavior of `bill_length_mm` after accounting for -->
<!-- `species`. Similarly, the points in the leverage plot for `species` have -->
<!-- a moderately strong linear relationship, so we expect `species` to have -->
<!-- moderate value in explaining the behavior of `bill_length_mm` after -->
<!-- accounting for `body_mass_g`. -->

<!-- ```{r leverageplot-lmodp, fig.cap = "Leverage plots for the predictors in the parallel lines model fit to the `penguins` data."} -->
<!-- leveragePlots(lmodp) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- We next examine the leverage plot for the separate lines model fit to -->
<!-- the `penguins` data. The fitted separate lines model is -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \begin{aligned} -->
<!-- &\hat{E}(\mathtt{bill\_length\_mm} \mid \mathtt{body\_mass\_g}, \mathtt{species}) \\ -->
<!-- &= 26.99 + 0.003 \mathtt{body\_mass\_g} + 5.18 D_C - 0.25 D_G \\ -->
<!-- &\quad + 0.001 D_C \mathtt{body\_mass\_g} + 0.0009 D_G \mathtt{body\_mass\_g}, -->
<!-- \end{aligned} -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- which has 6 estimated coefficients. However, the fitted model has only -->
<!-- 3 non-intercept terms. Recall the formula we fit for the separate lines -->
<!-- model: -->

<!-- ```{r, eval = FALSE} -->
<!-- # function call for separate lines model -->
<!-- lm(formula = bill_length_mm ~ body_mass_g + species + body_mass_g:species, -->
<!--    data = penguins) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Thus, we have terms for `body_mass_g`, `species`, and the interaction -->
<!-- term `body_mass_g:species`. -->

<!-- We use the code below to create the leverage plots shown in Figure -->
<!-- \@ref(fig:leverageplot-lmods). The leverage plot for `body_mass_g` has a -->
<!-- moderate linear relationship, so we expect `body_mass_g` to have -->
<!-- moderate additional value in explaining the behavior of `bill_length_mm` -->
<!-- after accounting for `species` and the interaction term -->
<!-- `body_mass_g:species`. It is unlikely we would include the -->
<!-- `body_mass_g:species` term in our model prior to including `body_mass_g` -->
<!-- , so philosophically, this plot provides little useful information. -->
<!-- Similarly, interpreting the leverage plot for `species` has limited -->
<!-- utility because the leverage plot includes the influence of the -->
<!-- interaction term `body_mass_g:species`. We are unlikely to fit a model -->
<!-- that includes the interaction term without also including the `species` -->
<!-- term directly. Instead it makes more sense to judge the utility of -->
<!-- adding `species` to the model regressing `bill_length_mm` on -->
<!-- `body_mass_g` alone, which we already considered in Figure -->
<!-- \@ref(fig:leverageplot-lmodp). Examining the leverage plot for the -->
<!-- interaction term `body_mass_g:species` , we see the points have only a -->
<!-- weak linear relationship. Thus, we expect limited utility in adding the -->
<!-- interaction term `body_mass_g:species` to the parallel lines regression -->
<!-- model that regresses `bill_length_mm` on `body_mass_g` and `species`. -->

<!-- ```{r leverageplot-lmods, fig.cap = "Leverage plots for the terms in the separate lines model fit to the `penguins` data."} -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## Going deeper -->

<!-- ### Orthogonality {#orthogonality} -->

<!-- Let -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \mathbf{X}_{[j]}=[x_{1,j},\ldots,x_{n,j}] -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- denote the $n\times 1$  -->
<!-- column vector of observed values for column $j$ of $\mathbf{X}$. (We can't use the -->
<!-- notation $\mathbf{x}_j$ because that is the $p\times 1$ vector of -->
<!-- regressor values for the $j$th observation). -->

<!-- Regressors -->
<!-- $\mathbf{X}_{[j]}$ and $\mathbf{X}_{[k]}$ are **orthogonal** if -->
<!-- $\mathbf{X}_{[j]}^T \mathbf{X}_{[k]}=0$. -->

<!-- Let $\boldsymbol{1}_{n\times1}$ denote an $n\times 1$ column vector of -->
<!-- 1s. The definition of orthogonal vectors above implies that -->
<!-- $\mathbf{X}_{[j]}$ is orthogonal to $\boldsymbol{1}_{n\times1}$ if -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \mathbf{X}_{[j]}^T \boldsymbol{1}_{n\times1} = \sum_{i=1}^n x_{i,j} = 0, -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- i.e., if the values in $\mathbf{X}_{[j]}$ sum to zero. -->

<!-- Let $\bar{x}_j = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i,j}$ denote the sample mean -->
<!-- of $\mathbf{X}_{[j]}$ and -->
<!-- $\bar{\mathbf{x}}_j = \bar{x}_j \boldsymbol{1}_{n\times 1}$ denote the -->
<!-- column vector that repeats $\bar{x}_j$ $n$ times. -->

<!-- **Centering** $\mathbf{X}_{[j]}$ involves subtracting the sample mean of -->
<!-- $\mathbf{X}_{[j]}$ from $\mathbf{X}_{[j]}$, i.e., -->
<!-- $\mathbf{X}_{[j]} - \bar{\mathbf{x}}_j$. -->

<!-- Regressors $\mathbf{X}_{[j]}$ and $\mathbf{X}_{[k]}$ are -->
<!-- **uncorrelated** if they are orthogonal after being centered, i.e., if -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- (\mathbf{X}_{[j]} - \bar{\mathbf{x}}_j)^T (\mathbf{X}_{[k]} - \bar{\mathbf{x}}_k)=0. -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- Note that the sample covariance between vectors $\mathbf{X}_{[j]}$ -->
<!-- and $\mathbf{X}_{[k]}$ is -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- \begin{aligned} -->
<!-- \widehat{\mathrm{cov}}(\mathbf{X}_{[j]}, \mathbf{X}_{[k]}) &= \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n (x_{i,j} - \bar{x}_j)(x_{i,k} - \bar{x}_k) \\ -->
<!--  &= \frac{1}{n-1}(\mathbf{X}_{[j]} - \bar{\mathbf{x}}_j)^T (\mathbf{X}_{[k]} - \bar{\mathbf{x}}_k). -->
<!-- \end{aligned} -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- Thus, two centered regressors are orthogonal if their covariance is -->
<!-- zero. -->

<!-- It is a desirable to have orthogonal regressors in our fitted model -->
<!-- because they simplify estimating the relationship between the regressors -->
<!-- and the response. Specifically: -->

<!-- *If a regressor is orthogonal to all other regressors (and the column of -->
<!-- 1s) in a model, adding or removing the orthogonal regressor from our -->
<!-- model will not impact the estimated regression coefficients of the other -->
<!-- regressors.* -->

<!-- Since most linear regression models include an intercept, we should -->
<!-- assess whether our regressors are orthogonal to other regressors and the -->
<!-- column of 1s. -->

<!-- We consider a simple example with $n=5$ observations to demonstrate how orthogonality of regressors impacts the estimated regression coefficients. -->

<!-- In the code below: -->

<!-- -   `y` is a vector of response values. -->
<!-- -   `X1` is a column vector of regressor values. -->
<!-- -   `X2` is a column vector of regressor values chosen to be orthogonal to `X1`. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- y <- c(1, 4, 6, 8, 9)       # create an arbitrary response vector -->
<!-- X1 <- c(7, 5, 5, 7, 7)      # create regressor 1 -->
<!-- X2 <- c(-1, 2, -3, 1, 5/7)  # create regressor 2 to be orthogonal to X1 -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Note that the `crossprod` function computes the cross product of two vectors or matrices, so that `crossprod(A, B)` computes $\mathbf{A}^T B$, where the vectors or matrices must have the correct dimension for the multiplication to be performed. -->

<!-- The regressor vectors `X1` and `X2` are orthogonal since their cross product $\mathbf{X}_{[1]}^T \mathbf{X}_{[2]}$ (in R, `crossprod(X1, X2)`) equals zero, as shown in the code below. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- # cross product is zero, so X1 and X2 are orthogonal -->
<!-- crossprod(X1, X2) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- In the code below, we regress `y` on `X1` without an intercept (`lmod1`). The estimated coefficient for `X1` is $\hat{\beta}_1=0.893$. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- # y regressed on X1 without an intercept -->
<!-- lmod1 <- lm(y ~ X1 - 1) -->
<!-- coef(lmod1) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Next, we then regress `y` on `X1` and `X2` without an intercept (`lmod2`). The estimated coefficients for `X1` and `X2` are $\hat{\beta}_1=0.893$ and $\hat{\beta}_2=0.221$, respectively. Because `X1` and `X2` are orthogonal (and because there are no other regressors to consider in the model), the estimated coefficient for `X1` stays the -->
<!-- same in both models. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- # y regressed on X1 and X2 without an intercept -->
<!-- lmod2 <- lm(y ~ X1 + X2 - 1) -->
<!-- coef(lmod2) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- The previous models (`lmod1` and `lmod2`) neglect an important characteristic of a typical linear model: we usually include an intercept coefficient (a columns of 1s as a regressor) in our model. If the regressors are not orthogonal to the column of 1s in our $\mathbf{X}$ matrix, then the coefficients for the other regressors in -->
<!-- the model will change when the regressors are added or removed from the model because they are not orthogonal to the column of 1s. -->

<!-- We create a vector `ones` that is simply a column of 1s. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- ones <- rep(1, 5)   # column of 1s -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Neither `X1` nor `X2` is orthogonal with the column of ones. We compute the cross product between `ones` and the two regressors `X1` and `X2`. Since the cross products are not zero, `X1` and `X2` are not orthogonal to the -->
<!-- column of ones. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- crossprod(ones, X1) # not zero, so not orthogonal -->
<!-- crossprod(ones, X2) # not zero, so not orthogonal -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- We create `lmod3` by adding adding a column of ones to `lmod2` (i.e., -->
<!-- we include the intercept in the model). The the coefficients for both -->
<!-- `X1` and `X2` change when going from `lmod2` to `lmod3` because these -->
<!-- regressors are not orthogonal to the column of 1s. Comparing the -->
<!-- coefficients `lmod2` above and `lmod3`, $\hat{\beta}_1$ changes from -->
<!-- $0.893$ to $0.397$ and $\hat{\beta}_2$ changes from $0.221$ to $0.279$. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- coef(lmod2) # coefficients for lmod2 -->
<!-- # y regressed on X1 and X2 with an intercept -->
<!-- lmod3 <- lm(y ~ X1 + X2) -->
<!-- coef(lmod3) # coefficients for lmod3 -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- For orthogonality of our regressors to be most impactful, the model's -->
<!-- regressors should be orthogonal to each other and the column of 1s. In -->
<!-- that context, adding or removing any of the regressors doesn't impact -->
<!-- the estimated coefficients of the other regressors. In the code below, -->
<!-- we define centered regressors `X3` and `X4` to be uncorrelated, i.e., -->
<!-- `X3` and `X4` have sample mean zero and are orthogonal to each other. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- X3 <-  c(0, -1, 1, 0, 0) # sample mean is zero -->
<!-- X4 <- c(0, 0, 0, 1, -1)  # sample mean is zero -->
<!-- cov(X3, X4)              # 0, so X3 and X4 are uncorrelated and orthogonal -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- If we fit linear regression models with any combination of `ones`, `X3`, -->
<!-- or `X4` as regressors, the associated regression coefficients will not -->
<!-- change. To demonstrate this, we consider all possible combinations of -->
<!-- the three variables in the models below. We do not run the code to save -->
<!-- space, but we summarize the results below. -->

<!-- ```{r, eval = FALSE} -->
<!-- coef(lm(y ~ 1))           # only column of 1s -->
<!-- coef(lm(y ~ X3 - 1))      # only X3 -->
<!-- coef(lm(y ~ X4 - 1))      # only X4 -->
<!-- coef(lm(y ~ X3))          # 1s and X3 -->
<!-- coef(lm(y ~ X4))          # 1s and X4 -->
<!-- coef(lm(y ~ X3 + X4 - 1)) # X3 and X4 -->
<!-- coef(lm(y ~ X3 + X4))     # 1s, X3, and X4 -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- We simply note that in each of the previous models, because all of the -->
<!-- regressors (and the column of 1s) are orthogonal to each other, adding -->
<!-- or removing any regressor doesn't impact the estimated coefficients for -->
<!-- the other regressors in the model. Thus, the estimated coefficients were -->
<!-- $\hat{\beta}_{0}=5.6$, $\hat{\beta}_{3}=1.0$, $\hat{\beta}_{4}=-0.5$ -->
<!-- when the relevant regressor was included in the model. -->

<!-- The easiest way to determine which vectors are orthogonal to each other -->
<!-- and the intercept is to compute the cross product of the $\mathbf{X}$ -->
<!-- matrix for the largest set of regressors we are considering. Consider -->
<!-- the matrix of cross products for the columns of 1s, `X1`, `X2`, `X3`, and -->
<!-- `X4`. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- crossprod(model.matrix(~ X1 + X2 + X3 + X4)) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Consider the sequence of models below. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- coef(lm(y ~ 1)) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- The model with only an intercept has an estimated coefficient of -->
<!-- $\hat{\beta}_{0}=5.6$. If we add the `X1` to the model with an -->
<!-- intercept, then the intercept coefficient changes because the column of 1s isn't orthogonal to `X1`. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- lmod4 <- lm(y ~ X1) # model with 1s and X1 -->
<!-- coef(lmod4) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- If we add `X2` to `lmod4`, we might think that only $\hat{\beta}_{0}$ -->
<!-- will change because `X1` and `X2` are orthogonal to each other. However, -->
<!-- because `X2` is not orthogonal to all of the other regressors in the -->
<!-- model (`X1` and the column of 1s), both $\hat{\beta}_{0}$ and -->
<!-- $\hat{\beta}_1$ will change. The easiest way to realize this is to look -->
<!-- at `lmod2` above with only `X1` and `X2`. When we add the column of 1s -->
<!-- to `lmod2`, both $\hat{\beta}_1$ and $\hat{\beta}_2$ will change because -->
<!-- neither regressor is orthogonal to the column of 1s needed to include -->
<!-- the intercept term. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- coef(lm(y ~ X1 + X2)) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- However, note that `X3` is orthogonal to the column of 1s and `X1`. -->
<!-- Thus, if we add `X3` to `lmod4`, which includes both a column of 1s and -->
<!-- `X1`, `X3` will not change the estimated coefficients for the intercept -->
<!-- or `X1`. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- coef(lm(y ~ X1 + X3)) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Additionally, since `X4` is orthogonal to the column of 1s, `X1`, and -->
<!-- `X3`, adding `X4` to the previous model will not change the estimated -->
<!-- coefficients for any of the other variables already in the model. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- coef(lm(y ~ X1 + X3 + X4)) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Lastly, if we can partition our $\mathbf{X}$ matrix such that -->
<!-- $\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X}$ is a block diagonal matrix, then none of the -->
<!-- blocks of variables will affect the estimated coefficients of the other -->
<!-- variables. -->

<!-- Define a new regressor `X5` below. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- X5 <- c(1, 0, 0, -1, 0) # orthogonal to ones, X1, not X4 -->
<!-- ``` -->


<!-- `X5` is orthogonal to the column of -->
<!-- 1s and `X1`, but not `X4`, as evidenced in the code below. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- # note block of 0s -->
<!-- crossprod(cbind(ones, X1, X4, X5)) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Note the block of zeros in the lower left and upper right corners of the -->
<!-- cross product matrix above. The block containing `ones` and `X1` is -->
<!-- orthogonal to the block containing `X4` and `X5`. This means that if we -->
<!-- fit the model with only the column of 1s and `X1`, the model only with -->
<!-- `X4` and `X5`, and then fit the model with the column of 1s, `X1`, `X4`, -->
<!-- and `X5`, then the coefficients $\hat{\beta}_{0}$ and $\hat{\beta}_{1}$ -->
<!-- are not impacted when `X4` and `X5` are added to the model. Similarly, -->
<!-- $\hat{\beta}_{4}$ and $\hat{\beta}_{5}$ are not impacted when the column -->
<!-- of 1s and `X1` are added to the model with `X4` and `X5`. See the output below. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- lm(y ~ X1)           # model with 1s and X1 -->
<!-- lm(y ~ X4 + X5 - 1)  # model with X4 and X5 only -->
<!-- lm(y ~ X1 + X4 + X5) # model with 1s, X1, X4, X5 -->
<!-- ``` -->
