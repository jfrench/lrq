        "If we add `X2` to `lmod4`, we might think that only $\\hat{\\beta}_{0}$ will change because `X1` and `X2` are orthogonal to each other. However, because `X2` is not orthogonal to all of the other regressors in the model (`X1` and the column of 1s), both $\\hat{\\beta}_{0}$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_1$ will change. The easiest way to realize this is to look at `lmod2` above with only `x1` and `x2`. When we add the column of 1s to `lmod2`, both $\\hat{\\beta}_1$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_2$ will change because neither regressor is orthogonal to the column of 1s needed to include the intercept term."
