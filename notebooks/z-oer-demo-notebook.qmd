# Load some data

```{r}
data(mtcars)
```

# Create some plots

Create a scatter plot of `mpg` vs `wt`.

```{r}
plot(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars,
     xlab = "weight (1000 lbs)",
     ylab = "miles per gallon")
```

# Build a model

```{r}
lmod <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)
```

# Fit of model

```{r}
plot(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars,
     xlab = "weight (1000 lbs)",
     ylab = "miles per gallon")
abline(lmod)
```
