<!-- You should explore every data set numerically and visually prior to modeling it. The data exploration process will aid you in finding errors in your data, locating missing values, identifying outliers and unusual observations, finding patterns in your data, deciding on a modeling approach, etc. -->
<!-- In order to properly explore the data, it is likely that you will need to prepare the data. Many data sets are initially poorly structured, have variables stored as an inappropriate data type, have poor variable names, etc. The process of preparing the data into a friendly format is known as "cleaning". -->
<!-- A systematic exploration of the data is essential to performing a correct analysis. We will demonstrate a systematic (but not exhaustive) exploration of the `penguins_raw` data set from the **palmerpenguins** package [@R-palmerpenguins]. -->
<!-- For brevity, we exclude some of the code output in analysis that follows. The excluded portion will be noted with `...`. -->
<!-- ## Raw Palmer penguins data -->
<!-- A data set in a package can be loaded into memory using the `data` function, specifying the `name` of the data set to be loaded, and specifying the package that contains the data. We do this for the `penguins_raw` data below. -->
<!-- ```{r data_penguins} -->
<!-- data(penguins, package = "palmerpenguins") -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- This command actually loads two data sets: `penguins_raw`, the data set we will be looking at, and `penguins`, a simplified version of `penguins_raw`. Note that this particular data set loads in a nonstandard way; we would normally expect to load the `penguins_raw` data using `data(penguins_raw, package = "palmerpenguins")`. -->
<!-- We could have also loaded the data set by running the following commands in the Console. -->
<!-- ```{r library-palmer-penguins} -->
<!-- library(palmerpenguins) -->
<!-- data(penguins) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- This second approach is overkill and loads everything the package includes into memory. If you are going to be using many functions or objects from a package, then the second approach is sensible. Otherwise, the first approach is more precise and is better coding practice. -->
<!-- The `penguins_raw` data set provides data related to various penguin species measured in the Palmer Archipelago (Antarctica), originally provided by @GormanEtAl2014. -->
<!-- The data set includes 344 observations of 17 variables. The variables are: -->
<!-- * `studyName`: a `character` variable indicating the expedition from which the data were collected. -->
<!-- * `Sample Number`: a `numeric` variable denoting the continuous number sequence for each sample. -->
<!-- * `Species`: a `character` variable indicating the penguin species. -->
<!-- * `Region`: a `character` variable denoting the region of the Palmer LTER sampling grid the sample was obtained. -->
<!-- * `Island`: a `character` variable indicating the island on which the penguin was observed. -->
<!-- * `Stage`: a `character` variable indicating the reproductive stage of the observation. -->
<!-- * `Individual ID`: a `character` variable indicating the unique identification number for each individual in the data set. -->
<!-- * `Clutch Completion`: a `character` variable indicating whether the study nest was observed with a "full clutch" of 2 eggs. -->
<!-- * `Date Egg`: a `Date` variable indicating the date that the study nest was observed with 1 egg. -->
<!-- * `Culman Length (mm)`: a `numeric` variable indicating the length of the dorsal ridge of the penguin's bill in millimeters. -->
<!-- * `Culmen Depth (mm)`: a `numeric` variable indicating the indicating the depth of the dorsal ridge of the penguin's bill in millimeters. -->
<!-- * `Flipper Length (mm)`: a `numeric` variable indicating the penguin's flipper length in millimeters. -->
<!-- * `Body Mass (g)`: a `numeric` variable indicating the penguin's body mass in grams. -->
<!-- * `Sex`: a `character` variable indicating the penguin's sex (`FEMALE`, `MALE`) -->

<!-- * `Delta 15 N (o/oo)`: a `numeric` variable indicating the ratio of stable isotopes 15N:14N. -->
<!-- * `Delta 13 C (o/oo)`: a `numeric` variable indicating the ratio of stable isotopes 15C:12C. -->
<!-- * `Comments`: a `character` variable providing additional information about the observation. -->
<!-- ## Initial data cleaning -->
<!-- The `str` function is a great first function to apply on a newly loaded data set that you aren't familiar with because it provides a general overview of the data's structure. -->
<!-- ```{r str-penguins-raw, out.lines = 17} -->
<!-- str(penguins_raw, give.attr = FALSE) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- We see that the `penguins_raw` object is a `tibble`, a special kind of data frame provided by the **`tibble`** package [@R-tibble] as part of the broader **`tidyverse`**. It has 344 rows and 17 columns. In general, a `tibble` will function like a standard data frame, though its behavior may change when **`tidyverse`** packages are loaded. In the code below, we confirm that `penguins_raw` qualifies as a **base** R `data.frame`. -->
<!-- ```{r isdataframe-penguins-raw} -->
<!-- is.data.frame(penguins_raw) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- An alternative to `str` is the `glimpse` function from the `dplyr` package. `dplyr::glimpse` also summarizes the structure of an object, but also automatically formats the printed output to the size of the Console to make it more readable. An example is provided below. -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- dplyr::glimpse(penguins_raw) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- Another thing that we notice about `penguins_raw` is that it has terrible variable names. The variable names have a mixture of lowercase and uppercase letters, parentheses, and even spaces! This makes it complicated to access variables in the data frame. To access the flipper length variable, we would have to use something like the command below. Note the `` ` ` `` around "Flipper Length (mm)" because of the spaces in the variable name. -->
<!-- ```{r penguins_raw_flipper_length, out.lines = 5} -->
<!-- penguins_raw$`Flipper Length (mm)` -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- In *The tidyverse style guide* [@tidyversestyleguide], Hadley Wickham recommends: -->
<!-- > Variable and function names should use only lowercase letters, numbers, and \_. Use underscores (\_) (so called snake case) to separate words within a name. -->
<!-- We will apply this recommendation to the `penguins_raw` data below. -->
<!-- Additionally, many variables will be extraneous for our future analyses, so we will select only the ones that we will use in the future. We the `subset` function to select the `Species`, `Island`, `Culmen Length (mm)`, `Culmen Depth (mm)`, `Flipper Length (mm)`, `Body Mass (g)`, and `Sex` variables of `penguins_raw` and assign the subsetted data frame the name `penguins_clean`. -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- # select certain columns of penguins_raw, assign new name -->
<!-- penguins_clean <- -->
<!--   penguins_raw |> -->
<!--   subset(select = c("Species", "Island", "Culmen Length (mm)", "Culmen Depth (mm)", "Flipper Length (mm)", "Body Mass (g)", "Sex")) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- To rename the columns of `penguins_clean`, we use the `names` function to access the column names of the data frame and replace it with a vector containing the desired column names. A second usage of `names` confirms that the data frame now has improved column names. -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- # access column names and replace with new names -->
<!-- names(penguins_clean) <- c("species", "island", "bill_length", "bill_depth", "flipper_length", "body_mass", "sex") -->
<!-- # look at new column names -->
<!-- names(penguins_clean) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- There are still some issues with `penguins_clean`. The most notable issues are that the `species`, `island`, and `sex` variables are categorical, but are represented as `character` vectors. These variables should each be converted to a `factor`. We use the `transform` function to convert the each variable to a `factor`. Notice that we must replace the original `penguins_clean` object with the transformed object using the assignment operator. We then run the `str` function to confirm the structure change occurred. -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- # convert sex variable to factor, replace original object -->
<!-- penguins_clean <- -->
<!--   penguins_clean |> -->
<!--   transform(species = factor(species), island = factor(island), sex = factor(sex)) -->
<!-- # view structure -->
<!-- str(penguins_clean) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- Our conversion of `species`, `island`, and `sex` to `factor` variables was successful. However, we notice that the `levels` of `sex` are `MALE` and `FEMALE`, which is visually unappealing. Also, the levels of `species` are extremely long, which can create formatting challenges. We simplify both below. First, we confirm the factor levels of the two variables. -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- # determine levels of species and sex -->
<!-- levels(penguins_clean$species) -->
<!-- levels(penguins_clean$sex) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- We now change the levels of each variable in the same order they are printed above and confirm that the changes were successful. -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- # update factor levels of species and sex -->
<!-- levels(penguins_clean$species) <- c("adelie", "chinstrap", "gentoo") -->
<!-- levels(penguins_clean$sex) <- c("female", "male") -->
<!-- # confirm that changes took effect -->
<!-- str(penguins_clean) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- Our initial data cleaning process is now completed. As we explore our data further, it may become clear that additional data cleaning is needed. -->
<!-- ## Numerical summarization of data -->
<!-- Numerical exploration of a data set generally consists of computing various relevant statistics for each of the variables in a data set in order to summarize the data. A relevant statistic will depend on the type of data being analyzed. -->

<!-- Table \@ref(tab:numsum-table) provides an overview of common numerical summaries used to explore data, the type of data that can be summarized, what is summarized, and the function to compute the summary. -->
<!-- ```{r numsum-table, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- summary = c("mean", "median", "variance", "standard deviation", -->
<!--             "interquartile range", "quantiles", "correlation", "frequency  distribution", "relative frequency distribution") -->
<!-- variable_type = rep(c("`numeric`", "`factor`"), times = c(7, 2)) -->
<!-- summarizes = c("center", "center", "spread", "spread", "spread", -->
<!--                "center and spread", "similarity", "counts", "proportions") -->
<!-- r_function = c("`mean`", "`median`", "`var`", "`sd`", "`quantile` (modified)", -->

<!--                "`quantile`", "`cor`", "`table`", "`table` (modified)") -->
<!-- num_sum_df = data.frame(summary = summary, -->
<!--                         variable_type = variable_type, -->
<!--                         summarizes = summarizes, -->
<!--                         r_function = r_function) -->
<!-- kbl(num_sum_df, -->
<!--     caption = "A summary of the numeric summaries frequently used for different types of data, the types of variable they are used for, the information provided, and the R function used to compute it.", -->
<!--     col.names = c("numeric summary", "variable type", "summarizes", "R function"), -->
<!--     booktabs = TRUE, -->
<!--     escape = FALSE) |> -->
<!--   kable_styling(full_width = FALSE) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- We provide additional explanation about the numeric summaries in what follows. -->
<!-- ### Numeric data -->
<!-- Numerical exploration of a set of `numeric` values usually focuses on determining the: -->
<!-- 1. center -->
<!-- 2. spread -->
<!-- 3. quantiles (less common). -->
<!-- It can also be useful to compute the correlation between two `numeric` variables. -->
<!-- #### Measures of center -->
<!-- The sample mean and median are the most common statistics used to represent the "center" of a set of numeric values. -->
<!-- The sample mean or average is obtained by adding all values in the sample and dividing by the number of observations. The sample mean is the most commonly used measure of center. A weakness of the sample mean is that it is easily affected by outliers (values that are very large or small compared to the rest of the data values). Formally, if $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ are a sample of $n$ numeric values, then the sample mean is computed as $$\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i.$$ The sample mean can be computed in R using `mean`. -->
<!-- The sample median is the middle value of an ordered set of values (the actual middle value for when the number of values is odd and the average of the two middle values if there are an even number of values). Alternatively, the median is identical to the 0.5 quantile of the data. The median is considered more "resistant" because it is not so greatly affected by outliers. The median of the values 1, 8, 7, 6, 100 is 7. The median of the values 1, 8, 7, 6, 100, 4 is 6.5. The median can be computed in R using `median`. -->
<!-- We compute the mean of the `body_mass` variable of the `penguins_clean` data in the code below. -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- mean(penguins_clean$body_mass) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- Why is the result `NA` instead of a number? In general, an `NA` value "poisons" any calculation it is part of, with the function returning `NA`. Even a single `NA` value will cause a calculation to return `NA`, even if there are thousands or millions of non-`NA` values. If you want to compute the sample mean of the non-`NA` values, then you must change the `na.rm` argument of `mean` to `TRUE`, which makes the `mean` function to temporarily remove `NA`s prior to calculation. The `na.rm` argument is provided in many other functions, as we'll see in subsequent examples. We now compute the sample mean and median of the `body_mass` variable in `penguins_clean`, ignoring `NA` values. -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- # compute sample mean and median body_mass, ignoring NAs -->
<!-- mean(penguins_clean$body_mass, na.rm = TRUE) -->
<!-- median(penguins_clean$body_mass, na.rm = TRUE) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- We see the that average penguin `body_mass` is approximately 4201 grams, while the median value is 4050 grams. Since the median is less than the mean (i.e., large values are pulling the mean in the positive direction) the data *may* be positively skewed, but we will need to look at a histogram or density plot of the data to be sure (these plots are discussed in Sections \@ref(histograms) and \@ref(density-plots)). -->
<!-- #### Quantiles -->
<!-- We introduce quantiles before spread because we refer to quantiles in the discussion of spread. -->
<!-- Informally, the *p*th quantile (where $0\leq p \leq 1$) of a set of values is the value that separates the smallest $100 p$% of the values from the upper $100(1-p)$% of the values. e.g., the 0.25 sample quantile (often called Q1) of a set of values is the value that separates the smallest 25% of the values from the largest 75% of the values. -->
<!-- The `quantile` function is used to compute sample quantiles. There are actually many competing approaches to computing sample quantiles (which we don't discuss or worry about). Run `?quantile` in the Console if you are interested in learning more about the approaches used by R. -->
<!-- Quantiles are useful quantifying both the center (median) and spread (minimum and maxmimum or interquartile range) of a set of values. -->
<!-- We use the `quantile` function to compute the minimum (0 quantile), Q1 (0.25 quantile), median (0.5 quantile), Q3 (0.75 quantile), and maximum (1 quantile) of `body_mass` in the code below. The desired quantiles are provided as a `numeric` vector to the `probs` argument. -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- quantile(penguins_clean$body_mass, probs = c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1), -->
<!--          na.rm = TRUE) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- We see that the smallest and largest body masses are 2700 grams and 6300 grams, so the range of the data is $6300 - 2700 = 3600$ grams. Q1 is 3550 grams, while Q3 is 4750 grams. Since Q3 and the maximum are further from the median than Q1 and the minimum, respectively, this is additional evidence that this variable may be positively skewed (stretched out in the postive direction), but we really need to visualize the data to confirm this. -->
<!-- #### Measures of spread -->
<!-- In addition to identifying the center of a set of values, it is important to measure their spread, i.e., how variable the values are. -->
<!-- The sample variance and standard deviation are the most common measures of spread for numeric values. The sample variance of a set of values is the (approximate) average of the squared deviation of each observation from the sample mean, i.e., the sample variance is $$s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2.$$ The sample standard deviation is the square root of the sample variance and is generally a more useful measure of spread because it is has the same units as the original data. The larger the standard deviation or variance of a set of values, the more they vary from their sample mean. The sample standard deviation and variance can be greatly affected by outliers. The `var` function computes the sample variance while `sd` computes the sample standard deviation. -->
<!-- The interquartile range is a more resistant measure of spread based on quantiles. The interquartile range is the difference between the 0.75 and 0.25 quantiles of a data set. -->
<!-- The minimum and maximum (in relation to the sample mean or median) can also be used to ascertain the spread of a data set. The minimum and maximum values are computed using the `min` and `max` functions, respectively. -->
<!-- We compute these measures of spread for the `body_mass` variable below. -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- # sample variance -->
<!-- var(penguins_clean$body_mass, na.rm = TRUE) -->
<!-- # sample standard deviation -->
<!-- sd(penguins_clean$body_mass, na.rm = TRUE) -->
<!-- # interquartile range (names = FALSE removes text above the results) -->
<!-- quantile(penguins_clean$body_mass, probs = 0.75, -->
<!--          na.rm = TRUE, names = FALSE) - -->
<!--   quantile(penguins_clean$body_mass, probs = 0.25, -->
<!--            na.rm = TRUE, names = FALSE) -->
<!-- # minimum -->
<!-- min(penguins_clean$body_mass, na.rm = TRUE) -->
<!-- # maximum -->
<!-- max(penguins_clean$body_mass, na.rm = TRUE) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- The sample variance of `body_mass` is 643131.1 grams^2, which isn't easy to interpret. The sample standard deviation is almost 802 grams. So the "typical" deviation of a `body_mass` value from the sample mean is about 800 grams. The interquartile range is 1200 grams. The minimum and maximum values match what we saw the Section \@ref(quantiles). -->
<!-- #### Correlation -->
<!-- The correlation between two `numeric` variables quantifies the strength and direction of their linear relationship. The most common correlation statistic is Pearson's correlation statistic. If $x_1, x_2, x_n$ and $y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n$ are two sets of `numeric` values, then the sample correlation statistic is computed as $$r = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n\left(\frac{x_i - \bar{x}}{s_x}\right)\left(\frac{y_i - \bar{y}}{s_y}\right),$$ where $\bar{x}$ and $s_x$ denote the sample mean and standard deviation of the $x$'s with $\bar{y}$ and $s_y$ denoting the same thing for the $y$'s. $r$ must be between -1 and 1. The `cor` function can be used to compute the sample correlation between two `numeric` variables. -->
<!-- The closer $r$ is to -1 or 1, the closer the data values fall to a straight line when we plot $(x_i, y_i)$, $i=1,2,\ldots,n$ in a scatter plot (discussed in Section ). Values close to 0 indicate that there is no linear relationship between the two variables. Negative $r$ values indicate a negative relationship between the two variables (as values for one variable increase, the values for the other variable tend to decrease). Positive $r$ values indicate a positive linear relationship between the two variables (as values for one variable increase, the values of the other variable also tend to increase). -->
<!-- In the code below, we compute the sample correlation between all `numeric` variables in `penguins_clean`. We set `use = "pairwise.complete.obs"` so that all non-`NA` pairs of values are used in the calculation. -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- # determine whether each variable is numeric -->
<!-- num_col <- unlist(lapply(penguins_clean, is.numeric)) -->
<!-- # observe results -->
<!-- num_col -->
<!-- # compute correlation of numeric variables -->
<!-- cor(penguins_clean[, num_col], use = "pairwise.complete.obs") -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- Commenting on the output, we see that the values of each variable are perfectly correlated with themselves (this is always true since the values in each pairs are identical). The correlation between `bill_length` and `body_mass` is 0.87, so the larger a penguin is, the larger its bill tends to be. Perhaps surprisingly, the correlation between `bill_length` and `bill_depth` is -0.24, so the longer a bill becomes, the shallower (narrower) we expect the depth to be. Similarly, the correlation between `bill_depth` and `body_mass` is -0.47, so larger penguins tend to have narrower bills. -->
<!-- We briefly explain why we didn't simply use the `cor` function on `penguins_clean` directly. If we try to use `cor` on `penguins_clean` naively, then R will return an error because not all variables in `penguins_clean` are `numeric`. To account for this, we create a vector that determines whether a variable in `penguins_clean` is `numeric`. Recall that a `data.frame` object is a specially-structured `list` object, with each variable being an element of the `list`. The `lapply` function applies a function (`is.numeric` in this case) to each element of the supplied `list`. In our case, we use this to determine whether each variable is `numeric`. The result is returned as a `list`, so we use the `unlist` function to simplify the `list` to a `vector`. -->
<!-- ### Categorical data -->
<!-- The statistics mentioned in the previous section are generally not appropriate for a categorical variable. Instead, a frequency distribution or relative frequency distribution might be a useful numeric summary of categorical data. -->

<!-- The `table` function returns a contingency table summarizing the number of observations having each level. Note that by default, the table ignores `NA` values. -->
<!-- We see that for the `sex` variable, there are 165 female penguins and 168 male penguins. -->
<!-- ```{r} -->

<!-- table(penguins_clean$sex) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- To count the `NA` values (if present), we can set the `useNA` argument of `table` to `"ifany"`. -->
<!-- We see that 11 of the observations had no available information on `sex`. -->
<!-- ```{r} -->

<!-- table(penguins_clean$sex, useNA = "ifany") -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- A relative frequency distribution summarizes the proportion or percentage of observation with each level of a categorical variable. To compute the relative frequency distribution of a variable, we must divide the frequency distribution by the number of observations. If you want to ignore `NA`s, then you can use the following code, which takes the frequency distribution of `sex` and divides by the number of non-`NA` `sex` values. -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- # divide the frequence distribution of sex by the number of non-NA values -->

<!-- table(penguins_clean$sex)/sum(!is.na(penguins_clean$sex)) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- We see that slightly under 50% of the `sex` values are female (not accounting for `NA` values) are just over 50% are male. -->
<!-- Are you wondering what `sum(!is.na(penguins_clean$sex))` is doing in the code above? The  `is.na` function returns a `TRUE` for each value that is `NA` but otherwise returns `FALSE`. The `!` in front of `is.na` inverts the logical expression so that we are determining whether each value is NOT an `NA` (and returns `TRUE` if the value is not `NA`). It is common in programming associated `TRUE` with `1` and `FALSE` with `0`. So if we `sum` the the values that are not `NA`, that is equivalent to counting the number of non-`NA` observations. -->

<!-- If we want to include the `NA` values in our table, we can use the code below. -->
<!-- ```{r} -->

<!-- table(penguins_clean$sex, useNA = "ifany")/length(penguins_clean$sex) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- We do not know the `sex` of approximately 3% of the penguins observations. -->
<!-- ### The `summary` function -->
<!-- The `summary` function provides a simple approach for quickly quantifying the center and spread of each `numeric` variable in a data frame or determining the frequency distribution of a `factor` variable. More specifically, the `summary` function will compute the minimum, 0.25 quantile, mean, median, 0.75 quantile, and maximum value of a `numeric` variable and will return the frequency distribution (including `NA` values) of `factor` variable. -->
<!-- A `summary` method is available for a `data.frame` object, which means that we can apply the `summary` function directly to our `penguins_clean` data frame, which we do so below. -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- summary(penguins_clean) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- We conveniently get a numeric summary of all of the variables in our data set (you will see different results for variables that are not `factor` or `numeric` type). The `summary` function all makes it easy to identify the presence of any `NA`s in a variable. -->
<!-- ## Visual summaries of data -->
<!-- Visual summaries (i.e., plots) of data are vital to understanding your data prior to modeling. They help us to spot errors in our data, unusual observations, and simple patterns. They are also important after modeling to communicate the results of your analysis. -->
<!-- We will introduce basic visualization approaches using **base** R functions as well as the popular **ggplot2** package [@R-ggplot2]. It is important to know the basic plotting capabilities of **base** R (particularly the `plot` function, which has been extended by many packages to provide standard plots for complex objects produced by those packages). However, **ggplot2** is able to produce complex graphics with automated legends in a consistent, systematic way, which provides it advantages over **base** graphics in many contexts. -->

<!-- Table \@ref(tab:viz-sum) provides an overview of different plots types that can be used to summarize data, the type of data being summarized, whether the plot is for univariate (one variable), bivariate (two variable), or multivariate (3 or more variables) data, the **base** R functions create the plot, and the main **ggplot2** functions need to create the plot. The table is not intended to be an exhaustive list of  useful graphics you should use for data exploration. -->

<!--   kable_styling(full_width = FALSE) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- ### The ggplot recipe -->
<!-- There are 4 main components needed to produce a graphic using **ggplot2**. -->
<!-- 1. A data frame containing your data. -->
<!--     * Each column should be a variable and each row should be an observation of data. -->
<!-- 2. A `ggplot` object. -->
<!--     * This is initialized using the `ggplot` function. -->
<!-- 3. A geometric object. -->
<!--     * These are called "geoms" for short. -->
<!--     * geoms indicate the geometric object used to visualize the data. E.g., points, lines, polygons etc. More generally, geoms indicate the type of plot that is desired, e.g., histogram, density, or box plot, which aren't exactly a simple geometric argument. -->
<!-- 4. An aesthetic. -->
<!--     * An aesthetic mapping indicates what role a variable plays in the plot. -->
<!--     * e.g., which variable will play the "x" variable in the plot, the "y" variable in the plot, control the "color" of the observations, etc. -->
<!-- We add "layers" of information to a `ggplot`, such as geoms, scales, or other customizations, using `+`. -->
<!-- ### Univariate plots -->
<!-- A univariate plot is a plot that only involves a single variable. Examples include bar plots, box plots, histograms, density plots, dot plots, pie charts, etc. (the last two are are generally poor choices.) -->
<!-- #### Bar plots -->
<!-- A bar plot (or bar chart) displays the number or proportion of observations in each category of a categorical variable (or using R terminology, each `level` of a `factor` variable). -->
<!-- What are you looking for? Generally, categories that have substantially more or fewer observations than the other categories. -->
<!-- The simplest way to create a bar plot in base R is using the `plot` function on a `factor`. In the code below, we create a bar plot for the `island` variable of `penguins_clean`. We use the `main` argument to add a title to the plot. -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- plot(penguins_clean$island, main = "distribution of island") -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- We see that the largest number of penguins were obserevd on Biscoe allowed, followed by Dream and Torgersen islands, respectively. -->

<!-- Alternatively, we can combine `barplot` with the `table` function. We do so below for the `sex` variable. To account for `NA`s in the `sex` variable, we specify `useNA = "ifany"` in the `table` function. Also, we specify `names.arg = ...` to specify the bar names, otherwise the bar for `NA` will be blank. -->
<!-- ```{r} -->

<!-- barplot(table(penguins_clean$sex, useNA = "ifany"), -->
<!--         names.arg = c("female", "male", "NA")) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- We see that that there are slightly more male than female penguins, with a handful of observations missing this characteristic. -->

<!-- To create a relatively frequency bar plot, we should divide the results of `table` by the number of relevant observations. For this particular example, we could use the code below. We use the `length` function to determine the number of observations to divide the counts with. -->
<!-- ```{r} -->

<!-- barplot(table(penguins_clean$sex, useNA = "ifany") / -->
<!--           length(penguins_clean$sex), -->
<!--         names.arg = c("female", "male", "NA")) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- To create a bar plot with **ggplot2**, we first create a basic `ggplot` object containing our data. Make sure to load the **ggplot2** package prior to creating the plot, otherwise you'll get errors! -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- # load ggplot2 package -->
<!-- library(ggplot2) -->
<!-- # create generic ggplot object with our data -->
<!-- gg_penguin <- ggplot(data = penguins_clean) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- `gg_penguin` is a minimal `ggplot` object with the raw information needed to produce future graphics. To create a bar plot, we add the geom `geom_bar` and map the `species` variable (in this example) to the `x` aesthetic using the `aes` function. -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- # create bar plot for species variable -->
<!-- gg_penguin + geom_bar(aes(x = species)) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- #### Box plots -->
<!-- A box plot is a simple graphic showing critical quantiles of a `numeric` variable, as well as outliers. A box plot indicates the median, 0.25 quantile (Q1), 0.75 quantile (Q3), and extend bars to the largest and smallest observations that are not outliers. Outliers are usually marked with starts or dots. The standard definition of an outlier in the context of box plots is an value that is more than Q3 + 1.5 (Q3 - Q1) and less than Q1 - 1.5 (Q3 - Q1). The box of a box plot extends from Q1 to Q3, with a line in the box indicating the median. -->
<!-- Box plots are useful for identifying outliers and skewness in the variable. However, box plot throw away a lot of information, so be cautious in making conclusions about skewness and modality without seeking a histogram or density plot of the data. -->
<!-- The `boxplot` function is the easiest approach for producing a box plot using base R. We do so for the `body_mass` variable below. -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- boxplot(penguins_clean$body_mass, -->
<!--         main = "distribution of body mass") -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- The `body_mass` variable doesn't have any outliers. It's has perhaps a slight positive skew since the upper tail and upper part of the box are longer than the lower tail and lower part of the box. The median value is a bit larger than 4000 grams, while 50% of the data being between approximatly 3500 and 4750 grams (i.e., between Q1 and Q3). -->
<!-- To create a box plot using **ggplot2**, we use `geom_boxplot`. We create a box plot for the `bill_length` variable below. We map `bill_length` to the `y` aesthetic so that we get a vertically-oriented box plot (mapping it to `x` will produce a horizontal box plot). -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- gg_penguin + geom_boxplot(aes(y = bill_length)) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- There are not `bill_length` outliers. The minimum value is approximately 32 mm and the maximum is almost 60 mm. Q1 is approximately 39 mm, the median is approximately 44 mm, and Q3 is approximately 48 mm. It is difficult to assess the skewness of this data. The upper tail is longer than the shorter tail, but the upper box is shorter than the lower box, so the evidence is inconsistent. -->
<!-- #### Histograms -->
<!-- A histogram displays the distribution of a `numeric` variable. A histogram counts the number of values falling into (usually) equal-sized "bins" running from the smallest value to the largest value. The number of bins and width of the bins affect the shape of the histogram. -->
<!-- Histograms are used to assess skewness, modality (the number of clear "peaks" in the plot), and to some extent, outliers. -->
<!-- The `hist` function is used create a histogram of a `numeric` variable. We augment the information already learned about  `bill_length` with a histogram in the code below. -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- hist(penguins_clean$bill_length) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- The title and x-axis label are visually unappealling, so we use the `main` and `xlab` arguments to change them to nothing (i.e., no title) and `bill length (mm)`. We also increase the number of bins using the `breaks` argument. -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- hist(penguins_clean$bill_length, main = "", -->
<!--      xlab = "bill length (mm)", breaks = 20) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- This distribution of `bill_length` is bimodal (has two prominent peaks or modes). That is why the skewness information on the box plot of `bill_length` was inconsistent. This also demonstrates why should should never draw conclusions like modality or skewness from numeric summaries alone. -->
<!-- We use `geom_histogram` to create a histogram using **ggplot2**, mapping the variable to the `x` aesthetic. We do so for the `flipper_length` variable below. -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- gg_penguin + geom_histogram(aes(x = flipper_length)) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- Flipper length is also bimodal, with prominent peaks approximately centered around 190 and 220 mm. -->
<!-- #### Density plots -->
<!-- A density plot is similar to a smoothed histogram and the area under the smoothed curve must equal 1. In general, density plots are more visually appealing than histograms, but both communicate similar information. However, density plots can sometimes have problems near the edges of a variable with a fixed upper or lower bound because it is difficult to know how to smooth the data in that case. -->
<!-- The `plot` and `density` function can be combined to construct a density plot using **base** R. We do that below for the `bill_depth` variable below. Note the use of `na.rm` to remove `NA` that would otherwise poison the density calculation, and use `main` to have a blank title. -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- plot(density(penguins_clean$bill_depth, na.rm = TRUE), main = "") -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- The `bill_depth` variable is bimodal with peaks around 14 mm and 18 mm. The graphic also indicates that 342 observations were used to estimate the density and the bandwidth parameter was 0.5533. The bandwidth parameter controls the amount of smoothing and can be changed. Run `?stats::density` in the Console for more details. -->
<!-- We create a density plot with **ggplot2** using `geom_density`. We do so for the `body_mass` variable, mapping it to the `x` aesthetic. -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- gg_penguin + geom_density(aes(x = body_mass)) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- The `body_mass` variable is unimodal, with a peak around 3700 grams. It is also positively skewed. -->
<!-- ### Bivariate plots -->
<!-- A `bivariate` plot is a plot involving two variables. A `bivariate` plot can involve more than one data type. -->
<!-- #### Scatter plots -->
<!-- Scatter plots can be used to identify the relationship between two `numeric` variables. -->
<!-- We use the `plot` function to create a scatter plot of `bill_length` versus `body_mass` (the `y` variable versus the `x` variable) using **base** R below. The `plot` function is very flexible and can be used multiple ways to produce a scatter plot, but we will use the `formula` method that takes a formula describing the variables (`y ~ x`) and the data frame from which the variables come. -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- # xlab and ylab are used to customize the x-axis and y-axis labels -->
<!-- plot(bill_length ~ body_mass, data = penguins_clean, -->
<!--      xlab = "body mass (g)", ylab = "bill length (mm)") -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- There is a positive linear relationship between `body_mass` and `bill_length`. As `body_mass` increases, `bill_length` tends to increase. -->
<!-- The `geom_point` function can be used to create a scatter plot with **ggplot2**. we make the variables to be plotted to the `x` and `y` aesthetics. We create a scatter plot of `bill_length` versus `bill_depth`. -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- gg_penguin + geom_point(aes(x = bill_depth, y = bill_length)) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- It's difficult to make any definitive conclusion about the relationship of these two variables from this plot, as the plot is basically a blob of points. -->
<!-- #### Parallel box plots -->
<!-- A parallel box plot is used to display the distribution of a `numeric` variable whose values are grouped based on each `level` of a `factor` variable. Specifically, a box plot of the `numeric` variable is is constructed for all the values associated with the levels of the `factor`. Parallel box plot are useful for determining if the distribution of a `numeric` variable substantially changes based on whether an observation has a certain `level` of a `factor`. -->
<!-- Once again use the `plot` function with a `formula`, we can create a parallel box plot easily, with the syntax of the formula being `numeric variable ~ factor variable` (you can reverse these to change the box plot orientation). We parallel box plots of `body_mass` versus `sex` below. -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- plot(body_mass ~ sex, data = penguins_clean) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- We can see that the `body_mass` values tend to be larger for the male penguins compared to the female penguins. -->
<!-- We can produce something similar with **ggplot2** by specifying both the `y` and `x` aesthetics of for `geom_boxplot`. We do so below to compare `bill_length` for the different penguin `species`. -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- gg_penguin + geom_boxplot(aes(x = species, y = bill_length)) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- From a quick glance, we are able to see from the graphic above that the chinstrap penguins tend to have slightly larger bill lengths compared to the gentoo penguins, which typically have larger bill lengths than the adelie penguins. -->
<!-- ### Multivariate plots -->
<!-- A multivariate plot displays relationships between 2 or more variables (so bivariate plots are technically multivariate plots). We focus on multivariate plots using **ggplot2**. While the same graphics can be created with **base** R, it is substantially quicker to create an initial version of multivariate graphics with **ggplot2**. -->
<!-- #### Grouped scatter plot -->
<!-- A grouped scatter plot is a scatter plot that uses colors or symbols (or both) to indicate the `level` of a `factor` variable that each point corresponds to. You can actually use more than one `factor` variable, but interpretation often becomes much more difficult. The most common way to create a grouped scatter plot with **ggplot2** is to map a `factor` variable to the `color` or `shape` aesthetic of `geom_point`. **ggplot2** will automatically map the `factor` variable to unique colors or shapes and then indicates the mapping in a legend (this process is known as "scaling". -->
<!-- In the example below, we create a scatter plot of `flipper_length` versus `body_mass` that distinguishes the different `species` using `color`. -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- gg_penguin + geom_point(aes(x = body_mass, y = flipper_length, -->
<!--                             color = species)) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- The flipper length and body mass of gentoo penguins tend to be noticeably larger than the other two species, and there is the cluster of gentoo penguis is noticeably different in the plot. Chinstrap and adelie penguins tend to have similar flipper length and body mass, with chinstrap penguins tending to have slightly longer flipper length. -->
<!-- The graphic above can be made better in two ways. 1. Using better colors, and 2. Using more than one visual approach to distinguishing the levels of a `factor` variable. -->
<!-- Color blindness is a common visual impairment. The colors used above use both red and green, which may be difficult to distinguish. We should use a more friendly color palette. An excellent resource for choosing a color palette is [https://colorbrewer2.org](https://colorbrewer2.org) (@brewer). The webpage allows you to choose a color palette based on certain desired characteristics such as whether the palette is colorblind-friendly, printer friendly, etc. The recommend palettes can be accessed using the `scale_color_brewer` function. We use colorblind-friendly palette below. We also added a few additional customizations below. -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- gg_penguin + -->
<!--   geom_point(aes(x = body_mass, y = flipper_length, -->
<!--                  color = species, shape = species)) + -->
<!--   scale_color_brewer(type = "qual", palette = "Dark2") + -->
<!--   xlab("body mass (g)") + ylab("flipper length (mm)") + -->
<!--   ggtitle("body mass versus flipper length by species") -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- #### Facetted plots (and alternatives) -->
<!-- Facetting creates separate panels (facets) of plots based on one or more facetting variables. The key functions to do this with **ggplot2** are the `facet_grid` and `facet_wrap` functions. `facet_grid` is used to create a grid of plots based on one or two `factor` variables, while `facet_wrap` wraps facets of panels around the plot. We -->
<!-- Below, we facet scatter plots of `bill_length` versus `bill_depth` by `species`. -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- gg_penguin + -->
<!--   geom_point(aes(x = bill_depth, y = bill_length)) + -->
<!--   facet_grid(~ species) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- Whereas we previously couldn't discern a relationship between bill length and depth based on a single scatter plot, facetting by `species` makes it clear there is a positive relationship between `bill_length` and `bill_depth`. We could have used a group scatter plot for the same thing. -->
<!-- A simpler facetting example would be to facet density plots of `body_mass` by `sex` as shown below. -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- gg_penguin + geom_density(aes(x = body_mass)) + facet_grid(~sex) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- This plot is a bit difficult to interpret. We see that body mass is bimodal for the males and females. Perhaps this is related to `species`. Since the density plots are in different panels, its a bit tricky to see how they relate to each other. Also, the `NA` panel is probably not needed. -->
<!-- To get rid of the `NA` panel, we need to remove all of the observations with `NA` values. We do this below, using `subset` to select the desired columns and then using `na.omit` to remove any rows that have `NA` values for `body_mass`, `sex`, or `species`. Note that order matters here because `na.omit` removes any observation of the data frame that has an `NA` row. We save the filtered object as `penguins_temp`. -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- penguins_temp <- -->
<!--   penguins_clean |> -->
<!--   subset(select = c(body_mass, sex, species)) |> -->
<!--   na.omit() -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- In the next plot, we create density plots of the `body_mass` variable. However, we use the `fill` aesthetic to scale the `sex` variable so that the we distinguish the densities of male and female penguins with different colors. We set the `alpha` argument to 0.5 OUTSIDE the `aes` function (because it is being manually specified) so that the colors are translucent and blend. We also facet by species to see what the patterns look like for the different species. -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- ggplot(data = penguins_temp) + -->
<!--   geom_density(aes(x = body_mass, fill = sex), alpha = 0.5) + -->
<!--   facet_grid(~ species) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- We see that for all species, the body mass of the males tends to be larger than the females. -->
<!-- The examples above provide a small taste of the complicated graphics you can create with **ggplot2** using only a few lines of code. -->
<!-- #### Interactive graphics -->
<!-- There are many tools for creating interactive graphics in R. We have found the **`ggiraph`** package [@R-ggiraph] useful for creating interactive graphics based on **ggplot2**. However, it is a bit too complex to discuss here. -->
<!-- The **`plotly`** package [@R-plotly] is an R package to provide the capabilities of plotly [https://plotly.com/](https://plotly.com/), a well-known tool for creating interactive scientific plots. The `ggplotly` function will instantly make a `ggplot` interactive (though you may need to customize it for your needs). We provide two examples below. -->
<!-- First, we load the **`plotly`** package to have access to the `ggplotly` function. We then take our previous grouped scatter plot that plotted `flipper_length` versus `body_mass` distinguishing by `species` and assign it the name `ggi`. We then use the `ggplotly` function in make the graphic interactive. When you hover over a point, the plot interactively provides the exact `body_mass` value, `flipper_length` value, and `species` of the observation. -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- # load plotly package -->
<!-- library(plotly) -->
<!-- # assign grouped scatter plot name -->
<!-- ggi <- -->
<!--   gg_penguin + -->
<!--   geom_point(aes(x = body_mass, y = flipper_length, -->
<!--                  color = species, shape = species)) + -->
<!--   scale_color_brewer(type = "qual", palette = "Dark2") + -->
<!--   xlab("body mass (g)") + ylab("flipper length (mm)") + -->
<!--   ggtitle("body mass versus flipper length by species") -->
<!-- # make plot interactive -->
<!-- ggplotly(ggi) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- In the next example, we make parallel box plots of `bill_length` that distinguish between `species`. -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- # assign parallel box plot name -->
<!-- ggi2 <- -->
<!--   gg_penguin + -->
<!--   geom_boxplot(aes(x = species, y = bill_length)) -->
<!-- # make plot interactive -->
<!-- ggplotly(ggi2) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- The interactive parallel box plot provides information about the box plot of each species (such as the minimum `bill_length`, Q1, median, Q3, etc.) -->
<!-- ## A plan for data cleaning and exploration -->
<!-- We have provides many examples of data cleaning and exploration using the `penguins_raw` data. The analysis above is NOT exhaustive, and there are many additional numeric and visual summaries we could consider. We summarize a basic plan below for initial data cleaning and exploration that we have found useful. You will likely augment this process based on your own preferences and things you learn from the data. We assume you are working with a data frame, which is the most common data structure used for data analysis in R. -->
<!-- 1. Import or create the data set. -->
<!-- 2. Use the `str` function to get an idea of the initial structure. This can help to identify clear issues you may have had in importing the data, problems with variable names and types, etc. -->
<!-- 3. Clean the variable names based on your preferences. -->
<!-- 4. Convert the variables to the appropriate type (e.g., categorical variables to `factor`). -->
<!-- 5. Run the `summary` function on your data frame. Take note of `NAs`, impossible values that are data entry errors, etc. Perhaps perform some additional cleaning based on this information. -->
<!-- 6. Compute any additional numeric summaries of the different variables, as desired. -->
<!-- 7. Create univariate plots of all variables you are considering. Use histograms for discrete `numeric` variables, density plots for continuous `numeric` variables, and bar plots for `factor` variables. Take note of any interesting patterns such as modality, skewness, overall shape, outliers, etc. -->
<!-- 8. Create bivariate plots of any pairs of variables. Use scatter plots for two `numeric` variables. Use parallel box plots for `numeric` and `factor` variables or perhaps create histogram plots of the `numeric` variable facetted by the `factor` variable, or density plots of the `numeric` variables filled with different colors by the `factor` variable. Once again, notice any patterns. -->
<!-- 9. Create multivariate and interactive graphics based on what you learned in the previous steps. -->
<!-- ## Final notes on missing or erroneous data -->
<!-- What should you do with your data when observations are missing information or the information is clearly erroneous? -->
<!-- If the data are clearly erroneous, attempt to get the correct value. If the values cannot be corrected, replace them with `NA` since you don't have that information. -->
<!-- What should you do about `NA`s? There are many approaches for dealing with `NA`s. The proper approach depends a lot on WHY the data are missing. Speaking informally, if there is no systematic reason why the data are missing, then ignoring the observations with missing data isn't a terrible approach. However, if there is a systematic reason why the data are missing (such as individuals not wanting to answer a sensitive question, subjects dying for a specific reason) then ignoring that data can lead to erroneous conclusions. -->
<!-- In what follows, we will generally ignore missing data, assuming the problem is not systematic. -->

<!-- knitr::knit_hooks$set(output = hook_output) -->
