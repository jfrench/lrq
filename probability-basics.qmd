The mathematical field of probability attempts to quantify how frequently outcomes from a random experiment will occur.

We review some basic probability-related terminology in @tbl-prob-tab1.

```{r prob-tab1, echo = FALSE}
#| label: tbl-prob-tab1
#| echo: false
#| tbl-cap: Basic terminology used in probability.
#| filters:
#| - parse-latex
prob_tab1 <- data.frame(term = c("experiment", "outcome", "sample space", "event", "empty set"),
                        notation = c("N/A", "$\\omega$", "$\\Omega$", "$A$, $A_i$, $B$, etc.", "$\\emptyset$"),
                        definition = c("A mechanism that produces outcomes that cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.",
                                       "The simplest kind of result produced by an experiment.",
                                       "The set of all possible outcomes an experiment can produce.", "Any subset of $\\Omega$.", "The event that includes no outcomes.")
                        )

```

We make some notes about the terms in @tbl-prob-tab1:

- **Outcomes** are also known as **points**, **realizations**, or **elements**.
- An **event** is a set of outcomes.
- The **empty set** is a subset of $\Omega$ but not an outcome of $\Omega$.
- The **empty set** is a subset of every event $A\subseteq \Omega$.

## Basic set operations

We now review some basic set operations and related facts. Let $A$ and $B$ be two events contained in $\Omega$.

The **intersection** of $A$ and $B$, denoted $A \cap B$, is the set of outcomes that are common to both $A$ and $B$, i.e., $A \cap B = \{\omega \in \Omega: \omega \in A\;\mathrm{and}\;\omega \in B\}$.

Events $A$ and $B$ are **disjoint** if $A\cap B = \emptyset$, i.e., if $A$ and $B$ have no common outcomes.

The **union** of $A$ and $B$, denoted $A \cup B$, is the set of outcomes that are in $A$ or $B$ or both, i.e., $A \cup B = \{\omega \in \Omega: \omega \in A\;\mathrm{or}\;\omega \in B\}$.

The **complement** of $A$, denoted $A^c$, is the set of outcomes that are in $\Omega$ but are not in $A$, i.e., $A^c = \{\omega \in \Omega: \omega \not\in A\}$. The complement of $A$ may also be denoted as $\overline{A}$ or $A'$.

The set **difference** between $A$ and $B$, denoted $A \setminus B$, is the set of outcomes in $A$ that are not in $B$, i.e., $A\setminus B = \{\omega \in A: \omega \not\in B\}$. The set difference between $A$ and $B$ may also be denoted by $A-B$. The set difference is order specific, i.e., $(A\setminus B) \not= (B\setminus A)$ in general.

## Probability function

A **probability function** is a function $P$ that assigns a real number $P(A)$ to every event $A \subseteq \Omega$ and satisfies three properties:

1. $P(A)\geq 0$ for all $A\subseteq \Omega$.
2. $P(\Omega) = 1$. Alternatively, $P(\emptyset) = 0$. Informally, the probability that at least one of the possible outcomes in the sample space occurs is 1.
3. If $A_1, A_2, \ldots$ are disjoint, then $P\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i \right)=\sum_{i=1}^\infty P(A_i)$.

## Independence and conditional probability

A set of events $\{A_i:i\in I\}$ are **independent** if 
$$
P\left(\cap_{i\in J} A_i \right)=\prod_{i\in J} P(A_i )
$$
for every finite subset $J\subseteq I$.

The **conditional probability** of $A$ given $B$, denoted as $P(A\mid B)$, is the probability that $A$ occurs given that $B$ has occurred, and is defined as 
$$
P(A\mid B) = \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}, \quad P(B) > 0.
$$

## Additional probability results

The following probability results are frequently useful in solving practical problems:

- **Complement rule**: $P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)$.
- **Addition rule**: $P(A\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$.
- **Bayes' rule**: Assuming $P(A) > 0$ and $P(B) > 0$, then 
$$P(A\mid B) = \frac{P(B\mid A)P(A)}{P(B)}.$$
- **Law of Total Probability**: Let $B_1, B_2, \ldots$ be a countably infinite partition of $\Omega$. Then 
$$P(A) = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} P(A \cap B_i) = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} P(A \mid B_i) P(B_i).$$
